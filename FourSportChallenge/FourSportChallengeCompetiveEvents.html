    <p>It is expected that a 4 Sport Challenge event for individuals will consist of between 4 and 32 competitors.  

    <p>Events may be designated as female only, or open to all.

    <p>Individual competitors must participate in all 4 disciplines.

    <p>Within each discipline, the final results will rank the competitors from 1 thru N, where a competitor accumulates points for their relative position (e.g., winner of a discipline with 20 competitors will get a base score of 20 points, and will earn bonus points for coming in first, second place finisher would earn 19 points and slightly less bonus points, etc.).

    <p>The total points accumulated across all 4 disciplines will decide the final standings.

    <p>Since the goal of 4 Sport Challenge is to recognize skill across all disciplines, additional bonus points will be awarded for competitors which win (or perform well) across multiple disciplines.   And the bonus points increase for competitors that perform well in all disciplines.

    <p>Each 4 Sport Challenge will start with a foot race with a distance of either 1 mile, 2 miles, or 5K.  The goal of the foot race is to demonstrate minimum fitness requirements (after all, pickleball and basketball skills require some amount of running).  But the time requirements will be relatively easy to meet (e.g., for open division, minimum mile time will likely be 9 minutes, and for other divisions, it will likely be 10 minutes).

    <p>For table tennis and pickleball, there will be a 2 round qualifying tournament which decides playoff seeding.  For modestly small events (e.g., 8-12 players), playoff would likely be 2 rounds consisting of semifinals and finals.  For larger events, a quarter final round can be introduced.  It is expected that qualifying round would seed players based on predetermined skill level so that top players don't eliminate each other. It is also expected that matches will be scheduled so that all players have roughly the same "strength of schedule".  To minimize tie break scenario for playoff consideration, total games won, and points won, will be factored into the scoring model. Matches won will have the highest value, games won will have the second highest value, and finally, points won has the lowest value (but points won are still important, so in qualifying round, competitors should try to win as many points as possible).

    <p>To ensure that pickleball and table tennis matches don't extend event beyond time constraints, <a href="https://www.tabletennis365.com/Barnets/Pages/Expedite_Rule">expedited time rules will apply</a>. Additionally, for pickleball matches, scoring model is changed in that points are awarded for every point played (not just when server wins a point).  And for both pickleball and table tennis, the winning score will not exceed 16 points (e.g., if score reaches 15-15, then next point wins).

    <p>Basketball skills:
    <ul>
        <li>Free throws made in 2 minutes (player must self-rebound and dribble beyond foul line).
		
        <li>3-point shooting contest - 90 seconds, 5 racks each containing 5 balls, international 3-point line is used, no gimmick shots exist (i.e., no "money ball" which has higher value).
		
        <li>Obstacle course (timed). 
		
        <li>Depending upon size of event, either top 4 or top 8 will advance to playoff round.  Playoff will be one more round with final ranking resulting from the performance of the playoff round only (performance in qualifying round won't carry over).  The overall ranking of competitors in basketball skills will consider the rankings in all 3 sub-activities where cumulative score will determine the final ranking.  For free throw and 3-point shooting, ties are allowed - competitors which have the exact same number of made baskets will merely share that relative position and will thus get awarded the same number of points.  If cumulative ranking across all 3 sub-activities results in a tie, timed results (to the millisecond) in obstacle course will break the tie. 
    </ul>
	
	<p>Golf
	<ul>
	    <li>Depending upon size of event, either top 4 or top 8 will advance to playoff round.  For events with a large number of competitors, it might be necessary to hold qualifying round at an outdoor golf course (well, depending upon the capacity of the individual site hosting the competition).  Other factors which can be varied are the number of holes played to make playoffs (could be reduced to 9 hole qualifying round with additional sudden death holes played so that top 4 or top 8 players can be determined).
		
		<li>It is assumed that championship round would be played indoors with final ranking based on lowest golf score.  Extra sudden death holes played to determine winner only (ties are allowed for positions 3 thru N - for ties, those players will share the awarded points evenly).
	</ul>

<a name="TeamEvents">
<B>Team events</B>
<ul>
    <p>4 Sport Challenge team events involve 2 separate teams which compete against each other.

    <p>A team consists of between 4 and 8 players (8 is ideal - at least for coed team events).  For events where the two teams have a different number of players (e.g., one team has 4, and the other team has 8), the team with more players will be given certain scoring advantages.  The rationale for this is a team might only have 4 skilled competitors and thus may purposefully not present a full team.

    <p>Events may be open, coed, or female only.  Males obviously may not compete in female only events, nor can a male compete in a coed match other than in the slot designated for a male.  And to support the spirit of coed competition, a coed team must have at least one male competitor (but not more than 4).

    <p>For coed events, considering table tennis and pickleball, it is expected that each team will consist of 4 males and 4 females (although, as mentioned above, more females are allowed, as long as there is at least 1 male).  Coed team competition will consist of 1 male singles match, 1 female singles match, 1 male doubles match, 1 female doubles match, and 1 coed doubles match.   If all 5 matches were played concurrently, that would require a total of 4 males and 4 females, and would restrict a competitor from playing in more than 1 match.  But note, there is no requirement that pickleball and table tennis matches be played concurrently - respective team captains can mutually decide this.  But it is a requirement that all team members participate in both table tennis and pickleball.

    <p>The minimum number of competitors for a team event is 4, and for coed events, at least 2 must be female.   When considering table tennis and pickleball, with at least 2 females (and 4 total competitors), male and female singles match, and mixed doubles match, can all take place simultaneously.  Once those matches are played, the male and female doubles matches can take place.   When team sizes are reduced, it is expected that no competitor will play more than 2 table tennis or pickleball matches.

    <p>For table tennis and pickleball, the team which wins the majority of the matches is deemed the winner of that discipline.

    <p>For golf, it is expected that all team members will participate.   When both teams are at full strength, the best and worst rounds of golf for each team will be dropped, and then cumulative score will decide the winner (lowest aggregate score wins).  When teams are of different sizes, best and worst rounds are still dropped for each team.  But the team with more players not only can drop more of its bad rounds (to match the size of the other team), but can also drop the remaining best round from the team with less competitors (and obviously, another one of their bad rounds), if doing so changes the overall outcome.

    <p>In the event of a tie in golf, additional playoff holes will be played to determine a winner.  To expedite play, the playoff holes will be played by the top two players on each team, playing alternate shot until a winner is decided.   After 3 playoff holes, if a winner hasn't been decided, chipping contest with closest to the pin will decide the winner.   Location of chip will be randomly selected, and player going second may not watch the player going first.

    <p>For basketball skills, player results will be ranked from 1 to N in the 3 separate skills, and then aggregate ranking score per team will decide the winner (lowest score wins).   If teams have a different number of players, the team with more players not only can drop results of players from their team (to match number of players from other team), but can also drop results from one additional player from the other team (and one more from their team), if doing so changes the overall outcome.  If a tie exists in aggregate ranking score, then cumulative time of obstacle course (to the millisecond) will decide the winner.

    <p>For non coed team events, the ideal number of competitors on a team is 7 (minimum of 4 still applies).   With 7 competitors (for table tennis and pickleball), there would be 3 singles matches and 2 doubles matches.   All team members must compete in at least 1 match, and no team member may compete in more than 2 matches.   Additionally, no team member may compete in more than one singles or doubles match.   As for match pairing, when each team has full complement of 7 players, the team designated as the home team must submit their match roster first, and the road team can match its players as it deems most advantageous.  The only exception to this rule is if one team has fewer players than the other.  When that happens, the team with the greater number of players gets the advantage of match pairing.

    <p>It is assumed that all 4 disciplines will be completed.  A team is declared the winner when it wins at least 3 of the disciplines.  In the event that each team has won 2 out of the 4 disciplines, total matches won in pickleball and table tennis will break the tie. If total matches won is equal, then total games won will break the tie.  If that too is equal, the team competition may end in a tie.  But after exhausting previously mentioned tie break rules, for team competitions where a tie is considered inappropriate (e.g., playoffs, or when team captains mutually agree to a final tie breaker), basketball obstacle course can be used as a final tie breaker.   But for this tie breaker, 2 players will be picked from each team at random, with aggregate time determining the winner of the overall team competition.

    <p>Alternate tie break option - if it is decided that golf shall be the final discipline in the competition, then a sudden death playoff (similar to golf playoff rules described above) can be used instead of basketball obstacle course.   But when golf playoff is used for overall event tie break, the two golfers which complete shall be selected at random.

    <p>It is expected that team captains will mutually agree on all event options prior to the start of the competition (e.g., tie break strategy, order of event disciplines, match rosters, etc.).

    <p>For multi day events, it is expected that golf would be 18 holes, and table tennis and pickleball matches would be best of 5.

    <p>If 4 Sport Challenge event is to be completed in a single day, steps need to be taken to protect the health and well-being of the competitors.   For example, foot race might have to be completed at an earlier point in time. Additionally, table tennis and pickleball matches likely will need to be best of 3 (and not best of 5). And rounds of golf might have to be limited to 9 holes (instead of 18).

    <p>For large individual events (e.g., 20-32 players), facility space might prevent completion of event in a single day (i.e., might not have enough pickleball courts or ping pong tables, or might not have enough access to basketball courts).  Space availability would likely be an issue if entire event were held at an indoor site (especially with respect to golf, because it isn't expected that there would be many indoor chipping/putting greens).  For events where golf is played at an outdoor golf course, indoor basketball, table tennis and pickleball might not be as problematic because facility might contain sufficient number of courts.

    <p>When attempting to complete an event in the shortest amount of time, it is assumed that concurrent play will be used to accomplish this.   And for table tennis and pickleball, if playoffs rounds are being held, it is assumed that players will be given adequate rest between playoff matches so as to keep competition as fair as possible.   One way to ensure fairness is to have all playoff matches in a given round played at the same time, this way, no advancing player would have significantly more time to rest than others.   But some reasonable amount of recovery time should still be allowed, because not all matches will complete at the same time (even if they start at the same time).

    <p>Depending upon site configuration, it might be appropriate to have multiple disciplines being competed at the same time.   But as mentioned above, players health and safety must be taken into consideration, as well as overall fairness.   Therefore, breaks and recovery time for athletes must be considered.

    <p>It is assumed that all events will be captured on video, and when possible, matches should have a referee.  It is expected that technology would be available to resolve disputes (e.g., video replay), and better yet, cameras and software should be able to make calls automatically during live action.  It is expected that this technology will evolve over time, so 4 Sport Challenge events will need to continually adapt as technology improves.
