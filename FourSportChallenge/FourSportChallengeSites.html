<p>The foundation of 4 Sport Challenge is the site where 4 Sport Challenge events are hosted.  Although 4 Sport Challenge events could be hosted at existing sites (at traditional golf courses, and basketball, pickleball and table tennis centers), it is expected that specialized 4 Sport Challenge sites will arise so that competition can be hosted within a single indoor site.

  <p>Since 4 Sport Challenge is in the conceptual phase of development, and considering there are no official blueprints pending construction, the following vision expresses the possibility of what 4 Sport Challenge sites could be.  It is impossible to know how much of this vision will be integrated in initial sites, but over time, site features and scope will grow and evolve.  The goal is to express minimum requirements and let sites evolve into as grand a vision as humanly possible.  If it can be imagined, it can be built, so let the possibilities be endless.

  <p>The first premise behind 4 Sport Challenge is that events can be hosted entirely indoors.  But this doesn't preclude traditional golf courses from having a role in 4 Sport Challenge events.  For example, qualifying rounds of golf could be played on a traditional outdoor course - that would allow for a larger field of competitors.  But if outdoor golf is integrated with a 4 Sport Challenge event, it is expected that the championship round of golf be held within the indoor site.

  <p>To support indoor golf, at a minimum there would need to be a full size putting green and chipping area (including at least one front side sand bunker).  It is expected that chip shots of at least 20 yards would be possible. Of course, more than one green would be preferred, because this would allow for a more diverse and challenging golf experience.  Plus, with larger indoor facility, it would allow for more spectator viewing.
  
  <p>The other aspect which is essential for indoor golf is a driving range (needed for tee shot and approach shots to the green).  For small facilities, golf simulators could be used. But for a more realistic golf experience, an outdoor driving range can be integrated with the indoor site.  Imagine a tee box which is within the indoor site where the golfer hits directly to the outdoor driving range. After shot is completed (i.e., hit to outdoor driving range), automated software would predict where on the green the ball would come to rest. Note that golf simulation software allows for play on many different virtual courses, so final ball resting place would vary based on actual shot result when factoring in the shape and contours of the given virtual green.  Player would then place the ball on the indoor green as instructed by the golf simulation software (e.g., perhaps a red dot laser would mark the spot where ball should be placed) and complete the hole on the indoor green.  When hitting to a virtual green in the outdoor driving range, it is expected that clever use of lighting would allow for shading of the simulated green so that the player would have a realistic view of their target (which would include flag location, trees, water hazard, bunkers and rough).

  <p>Shown above are some examples of sites which could theoretically be integrated with a 4 Sport Challenge sporting event (this is for illustrative purposes only, these are not truly 4 Sport Challenge sites).  See section below for discussion on how pickleball courts, table tennis center and basketball skills can be integrated into the event competition area.

  <p>Indoor golf will likely take up the most amount of space - well, depending upon the number of indoor greens.   However, it would be possible to combine pickleball, basketball and table tennis into the indoor golf course layout.  This would maximize use of floor space, but perhaps would limit concurrent use of the space for all 4 sports.  Optimum use of space would be to put 4 greens in the 4 corners of a rectangular shaped gym, and then include space for the other 3 sports in the middle.  
  
  <p>A key takeaway for sites which host 4 Sport Challenge events is that the scale of a site can vary greatly.  The use of golf simulators or outdoor driving range can drastically reduce the amount of indoor space that is needed.  Space can also be reduced by limiting the number of pickleball courts and golf greens, or by making space multi-function (e.g., pickleball courts can share the same floor space as basketball).  But larger indoor sites will be able to support more competitors without increasing the time it takes to complete a 4 Sport Challenge event.  And with larger sites, it is expected that more spectators would be able to attend an event. Likewise, if a site operates as a retail training centers, more indoor space would allow for more paying customers.
  
  <p>The following is a sample configuration for an indoor facility which has 4 separate golf greens.  Drives and approach shots can either be hit using golf simulator technology, or optionally could be hit to an outdoor driving range (e.g., similar to TopGolf).  In addition to golf, site also supports basketball court, table tennis and pickleball.   
  
  <p><img src="IndoorGolf4GreensWithBasketballAndPickleball.jpg" alt="4 indoor greens">
 
  <p>A slightly smaller option supports only 2 golf greens.  And for this configuration, pickleball and table tennis would have to share the same space with basketball.  
  
  <p><img src="IndoorGolf2GreensWithBasketballAndPickleball.jpg" alt="4 indoor greens">
 
  <p>An even smaller option supports only 1 golf green with pickleball and table tennis sharing space with basketball.

  <p>The two most obvious sources of revenue for sporting events is broadcasting and spectator ticket sales.  But if site also includes hotel, restaurant, health and fitness, and retail sales, it can maximize revenue.  Plus, having guests stay for an extended period of time allows site to maximize revenue from each guest.  
  
  <p>Assuming a given site isn't fully booked with 4 Sport Challenge events, it can be utilized as a training center for paying customers that want to train in one or more of the 4 sports.  Health and fitness is big business, and if specialized instruction were available, it might give site owners a leg up on their competition (e.g., imagine potential revenue if a 4 Sport competitor also served as a coach for paying guests).
  
  <p>Site owners could lease space to corporate sponsors and external vendors, including retail space for things like 4 Sport Challenge equipment and apparel.
  
  <p>If site were generating broadcast content, it likely would lease space to one or more television networks.  Or, if the site managed its own broadcasting, it would still need a media and technology center.
  
  <p>As for hotel and luxury boxes, it is assumed that hotel rooms and suites would have a balcony which opened to the indoor event site.  It is also assumed that some amount of space would be reserved for general admission spectator viewing (like from promenades which overlook the indoor site).  Additionally, site could offer special VIP passes for hotel guests (among others) so that they could walk around the event floor as the competition was going on.  This would give them an up front and personal view of the action, and would be an additional source of revenue for the site.
  
  <p>Considering the sample site configurations shown above, hotel balconies, luxury suites, restaurants and promenades could wrap the sport complex on all sides (even on the side where outdoor driving range is shown - but for that side, viewing area would be built above the driving range).
  
  <p>Exact site configuration is left to the individual site owner.  And note, not every market has the exact same demands, so appropriate configuration for a given market is key.
