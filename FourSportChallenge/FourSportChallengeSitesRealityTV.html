<ul>
<p>Although it is ultimately expected that 4 Sport Challenge will evolve into a professional sports league (and thus have its own broadcasts), even before this happens, there are numerous opportunities for reality TV shows.  Here are a few examples.

<B>Site construction, technology and design competitions</B>
<ul>
   <p>The premise behind this reality show is 4 Sport Challenge site construction and technology. It is expected that 4 Sport Challenge sites will be both innovative and culturally interesting, so as sites come online, there would likely be some amount of interest in seeing how they are built, as well as seeing how technology is integrated into the site.  Examples of shows which already focus on things like this are: Modern Marvels, Extreme Engineering, and Dirty Jobs.
   
   <p>Although new construction for 4 Sport Challenge sites is expected, there might be opportunities to re-purpose existing sites, so another aspect of this reality show could be to tour decaying structures throughout the country and present designs to re-imagine them.
   
   <p>The TV network most aligned with this would be Discovery Channel (including HGTV, Science Channel, etc.). 

   <p><img src="RealityTVShowsSiteConstruction.jpg" alt="Examples of existing reality shows focusing on construction">
   
   <p>And since Americans seems to like shows which have some sort of competitive aspect, design competitions can be incorporated into the construction and design of 4 Sport Challenge sites.  In fact, designs could be submitted from anyone throughout the country, with reality show experts selecting the best designs to be presented on the show.  It is expected that show experts and fans voting would determine the top designs.  Then, design teams which are ultimately selected can do the build out, and industry and show experts can judge the final result.  
   
   <p>Examples of shows which already focus on this are: Brother vs Brother and Rock The Block.

<a name="FindingTheUltimate4SportAthlete">
<B>Finding the ultimate 4 sport athlete</B>
<ul>
   <p>The premise behind this reality show is to find the best 4 sport athletes.
   
   <p>The most obvious strategy to accomplish this would be to host 4 Sport Challenge events throughout the country and identify a subset of athletes that have the highest degree of skill across all 4 disciplines.
   
   <p>Film crews could collect footage of local events and then submit edited content to be included on the reality show.  Highly skilled competitors in local 4 Sport Challenge events could be funneled into regional events, thus narrowing in on those that are truly elite in all 4 disciplines.  Elite 4 sport athletes could be invited to compete in a year end tournament, which would also be filmed and included in the reality show.
   
   <p>An added benefit of using local (perhaps even amateur) film crews for local and regional 4 Sport Challenge events is that it offers an opportunity for those starting out in the broadcast industry to gain experience and exposure.  And as 4 Sport Challenge becomes more mature, there will be jobs available for those skilled in broadcasting.  Those submitting high quality content from local events would be auditioning for later job opportunities.  In fact, best amateur video content could even be worked into a competitive aspect of the reality show itself.
   
   <p>Additionally, a small film crew could travel the country making stops at various colleges to seek out those that are interested in 4 Sport Challenge.  It isn't known which college sports would have the best 4 sport athletes, and it isn't even known what level of interest college administrators would have in this relatively new enterprise. As for college athletes, it is possible that those that are on golf teams might have an advantage, because golf probably takes the longest amount of time to master.  But those on college basketball, tennis, pickleball, and table tennis teams might have something to say about this, so they all can be interviewed, and interesting discussions can be aired on the reality show.
   
   <p>Aside from visiting colleges, traveling film crew could seek out any and all other venues where potential 4 sport athletes might be lurking.  These include:
   <ul>
      <li>Professional sports teams
	  <li>Training centers and clubs which focus on golf, pickleball, and table tennis
	  <li>Health clubs
   </ul>
   
   <p>These additional venues might actually want to partner in local 4 Sport Challenge events (for either profit, or for charitable reasons).

   <p>The television network most aligned seems to be <a href="https://www.golfchannel.com/">The Golf Channel</a>.
</ul>



<a name="GameShowCompetitions">
<B>Game show competitions</B>
<ul>
   <p>The premise behind game show is amateurs competing against 4 Sport Athletes for prize money.
   
   <ul>
      <p>Candidate contestants would register at an authorized training center.  Registration process would include a self-assessment, after which competitors would be asked to play against a robot - see <a href="FourSportChallengeTech.html#TrainingAides">robotic training aides</a> for more information.  Data collected using a robot practice partner would be highly efficient and would make video collection and submission fair, easy and consistent.
   	  
	  <p>On the show, a contestant would get an opportunity to compete against one of many different opponents.  The opponent could be another contestant, or a 4 sport athlete that is made available by the show (such an athlete could be a celebrity, a professional, or someone that coaches 4 sports athletes).  
	  
	  <p>The contestant would have the opportunity to select the skill level of their opponent.  Alternatively, opponents' skill level could be determined by contestant's ability to answer trivial questions.  The contestant could be rewarded for correct answers by increasing the prize money awarded, or by decreasing the skill level of the opponent they have to beat (thus increasing their odds of winning).

      <p>Aside from prize money, awards could be things like 4 Sport Challenge apparel, free tickets to a 4 Sport Challenge team event, team VIP perks, or season tickets for their favorite team.  Obviously, team awards imply that professional teams and sites have come into existence.	  
   </ul>
   
   <p>The good thing about 4 Sport Challenge is that all sports can be played indoors (even golf).  This will make the show's competitive aspect very consistent, and it won't be impacted by external factors like weather.  To ensure consistency of show duration, some limitations will need to be placed on the individual competitive events.
   
   <ul>
      <p>Pickleball and table tennis can be a single game - race to 8 (no win by 2).  And for pickleball, it is expected that points would be awarded on each rally (not just when serving).
	  
	  <p>Golf could be up to 3 holes (ties would be allowed).
	  
	  <p>Basketball events are modestly short, so they perhaps don't have to be trimmed down at all.  But if desired, 3-point shooting could reduce the number of shot attempts, and for free throws, the time could be reduced.  Another option would be to have contestant and opponent perform 3-point shooting and free throws in parallel (split screen).  The benefit of parallel competition is that sound effects (e.g., crowd noise) could be used to signal a successful basket, thus increasing tension level for the participants (and perhaps enhancing excitement for viewers). 
	  
	  <p>Basketball obstacle course would serve as the tie breaker if 3-point shooting and free throws are split by the participants.  If obstacle course competition is needed to break a tie, it is expected that would not be run in parallel.	  
   </ul>
   
</ul>


<a name="CelebrityChallenge">
<B>Celebrity challenge</B>
<ul>
   <p>Although 4 Sport Challenge isn't intended to be a competition between two individuals, invariably a celebrity or athlete is going to call out some other celebrity or athlete, and challenge them to a match. The problem is that 4 Sport Challenge isn't intended to reward 1 or 2 sport athletes, and if the participants aren't well skilled in all 4 disciplines, it could result in a 2-2 split, and that wouldn't really resolve which participant was truly the best 4 sport athlete.  When each competitor wins 2 of the 4 disciplines, the following can be used to break the tie:
   
   <ol>
     <li>Add total games won in pickleball and table tennis to the number of basketball sub-activites won.   Competitor with the higher number is the winner.
	 <li>Otherwise, if a competitor won golf match by more than 9 strokes, then that competitor is the winner.
	 <li>Otherwise, a playoff will decide the winner.  The playoff will be in one of the 4 disciplines (selected at random).  For golf, sudden death playoff described in <a href="FourSportChallengeCompetiveEvents.html#TeamEvents">team event</a> will be used.  For pickleball and table tennis, a single game to 11 will decide the winner.  For basketball skills, one of the 3 sub-activities will be selected at random - winner of the sub-activity will be declared the winner.
	 <li>An alternative to random selection would be for the two competitors to mutually agree on a specific discipline.  This might occur if the two competitors were evenly matched in one of the disciplines.
   </ol>
   
   <p>If celebrity challenges were to take place, follow-up progress could be reported and rematches could be scheduled.  It is possible that exposing progress made by celebrities, including training regiment, might be interesting to viewers, and could inspire them to improve their skills.
