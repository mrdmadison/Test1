<ul>
<p>A highly inclusive athletic competition which places a premium on skill, while minimizing physical attributes like height, strength, speed and endurance.  And because 4 Sport Challenge is a green field, participation won't be limited to only professional athletes.  But in the spirit of inclusiveness, they too are welcome.
</ul>

<B>Athletic disciplines</B>
<ul>
  <p><B>Basketball skills</B> - separate timed activities:  free throw shooting â€“ competitor must self-rebound, 3-point shooting, and obstacle course.

  <p><B>Golf</B> - Traditional outdoor courses at first, with indoor driving range and synthetic chipping and putting greens expected in the future.

  <p><B>Pickleball</B> - Selected over tennis because of inclusiveness considerations (e.g., smaller court size, under hand service rule which prohibits serve and volley).

  <p><B>Table tennis</B>
</ul>  


<a name="BusinessAndTechnology">
<p><B>Business and technology</B>
<ul>
   <p>Site management - not only is there a need for physical sites to host 4 Sport Challenge events, it is expected that hospitality, health and fitness, broadcast and media centers, technology hubs and retail sales will be bundled within sites.
   
   <p>Robotics, video parsing, analytics and A.I. will be used in conjunction with 4 Sport Challenge events. Vendors which offer such technology are good candidates for advertising revenue and as business partners.
   
   <p>Professional athletes may want to participate as competitors in 4 Sport Challenge events, but also may make good business partners, including investing in, or owning, 4 Sport Challenge sites.
   
   <p>Colleges (and NCAA) are also good candidates for business partners - they already manage stadiums and arenas, so they likely will see this as an additional revenue stream with minimal investment (a 4 Sport Challenge site would be a fraction of the cost to build as compared to a typical basketball arena).
   
   <p>Traditional broadcast networks - reasons should be self-evident.  Plus, there are numerous reality show spins-offs that can be easily imagined.
   
   <p>Imagine 4 Sport Challenge / 4 League Challenge (NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB) Superbowl the day before and after Baseball's All-Star game. That would be must see TV.
   
   <p>International interest - hard to say?  Table tennis is more popular outside the United States, and since 4 Sport Challenge is a green field, it  might attract quite a bit of international interest.  With existing professional sport leagues in the U.S., if a foreign athlete is highly skilled, they come to the U.S. to compete.  This benefits the foreign athlete and the U.S. team owners, but does little or nothing for the athlete's home country.  And the cost of entry for a 4 Sport Challenge site would be a fraction of that for a franchise in any of the big 4 U.S. sports leagues (plus, opportunities to buy a franchise are few and far between). 
   
   <p>4 Sport Challenge as an Olympic event - if 4 Sport Challenge were to take off, then this would actually make a lot of sense.   
</ul>

<div id="SiteManagement" class="main-container city" style="display:none">
<p><B>Site management</B>

<ul>
<p>The foundation of 4 Sport Challenge is the site where 4 Sport Challenge events are hosted.  Although 4 Sport Challenge events could be hosted at existing sites (at traditional golf courses, and basketball, pickleball and table tennis centers), it is expected that specialized 4 Sport Challenge sites will arise so that competition can be hosted within a single indoor site.

</ul>

</ul>

<a name="SiteOverview">
<B>Site overview</B>
<ul>
  <p>Since 4 Sport Challenge is in the conceptual phase of development, and considering there are no official blueprints pending construction, the following vision expresses the possibility of what 4 Sport Challenge sites could be.  It is impossible to know how much of this vision will be integrated in initial sites, but over time, site features and scope will grow and evolve.  The goal is to express minimum requirements and let sites evolve into as grand a vision as humanly possible.  If it can be imagined, it can be built, so let the possibilities be endless.

  <p>The first premise behind 4 Sport Challenge is that events can be hosted entirely indoors.  But this doesn't preclude traditional golf courses from having a role in 4 Sport Challenge events.  For example, qualifying rounds of golf could be played on a traditional outdoor course - that would allow for a larger field of competitors.  But if outdoor golf is integrated with a 4 Sport Challenge event, it is expected that the championship round of golf be held within the indoor site.
</ul>

<a name="GolfFacility">
<B>Golf facility</B>
<ul>
  <p>To support indoor golf, at a minimum there would need to be a full size putting green and chipping area (including at least one front side sand bunker).  It is expected that chip shots of at least 20 yards would be possible. Of course, more than one green would be preferred, because this would allow for a more diverse and challenging golf experience.  Plus, with larger indoor facility, it would allow for more spectator viewing.
  
  <p>The other aspect which is essential for indoor golf is a driving range (needed for tee shot and approach shots to the green).  For small facilities, golf simulators could be used. But for a more realistic golf experience, an outdoor driving range can be integrated with the indoor site.  Imagine a tee box which is within the indoor site where the golfer hits directly to the outdoor driving range. After shot is completed (i.e., hit to outdoor driving range), automated software would predict where on the green the ball would come to rest. Note that golf simulation software allows for play on many different virtual courses, so final ball resting place would vary based on actual shot result when factoring in the shape and contours of the given virtual green.  Player would then place the ball on the indoor green as instructed by the golf simulation software (e.g., perhaps a red dot laser would mark the spot where ball should be placed) and complete the hole on the indoor green.  When hitting to a virtual green in the outdoor driving range, it is expected that clever use of lighting would allow for shading of the simulated green so that the player would have a realistic view of their target (which would include flag location, trees, water hazard, bunkers and rough). 
  
  <p><img src="SiteOverview_images.jpg" alt="4 sport home">

  <p>Shown above are some examples of sites which could theoretically be integrated with a 4 Sport Challenge sporting event (this is for illustrative purposes only, these are not truly 4 Sport Challenge sites).  See section below for discussion on how pickleball courts, table tennis center and basketball skills can be integrated into the event competition area.
</ul>

<a name="BasketballPickleballAndTabbleTennis">
<B>Basketball, pickleball and table tennis</B>
<ul>
  <p>Indoor golf will likely take up the most amount of space - well, depending upon the number of indoor greens.   However, it would be possible to combine pickleball, basketball and table tennis into the indoor golf course layout.  This would maximize use of floor space, but perhaps would limit concurrent use of the space for all 4 sports.  Optimum use of space would be to put 4 greens in the 4 corners of a rectangular shaped gym, and then include space for the other 3 sports in the middle.  
  
  <p>A key takeaway for sites which host 4 Sport Challenge events is that the scale of a site can vary greatly.  The use of golf simulators or outdoor driving range can drastically reduce the amount of indoor space that is needed.  Space can also be reduced by limiting the number of pickleball courts and golf greens, or by making space multi-function (e.g., pickleball courts can share the same floor space as basketball).  But larger indoor sites will be able to support more competitors without increasing the time it takes to complete a 4 Sport Challenge event.  And with larger sites, it is expected that more spectators would be able to attend an event. Likewise, if a site operates as a retail training centers, more indoor space would allow for more paying customers.
  
  <p>The following is a sample configuration for an indoor facility which has 4 separate golf greens.  Drives and approach shots can either be hit using golf simulator technology, or optionally could be hit to an outdoor driving range (e.g., similar to TopGolf).  In addition to golf, site also supports basketball court, table tennis and pickleball.   
  
  <p><img src="IndoorGolf4GreensWithBasketballAndPickleball.jpg" alt="4 indoor greens">
 
  <p>A slightly smaller option supports only 2 golf greens.  And for this configuration, pickleball and table tennis would have to share the same space with basketball.  
  
  <p><img src="IndoorGolf2GreensWithBasketballAndPickleball.jpg" alt="4 indoor greens">
 
  <p>An even smaller option supports only 1 golf green with pickleball and table tennis sharing space with basketball.  
  
  <p><img src="IndoorGolf1GreenWithBasketballAndPickleball.jpg" alt="4 indoor greens"> 
</ul>


<a name="RevenueGeneratingServices">
<B>Revenue generating services</B>
<ul>
  <p>The two most obvious sources of revenue for sporting events is broadcasting and spectator ticket sales.  But if site also includes hotel, restaurant, health and fitness, and retail sales, it can maximize revenue.  Plus, having guests stay for an extended period of time allows site to maximize revenue from each guest.  
  
  <p>Assuming a given site isn't fully booked with 4 Sport Challenge events, it can be utilized as a training center for paying customers that want to train in one or more of the 4 sports.  Health and fitness is big business, and if specialized instruction were available, it might give site owners a leg up on their competition (e.g., imagine potential revenue if a 4 Sport competitor also served as a coach for paying guests).
  
  <p>Site owners could lease space to corporate sponsors and external vendors, including retail space for things like 4 Sport Challenge equipment and apparel.
  
  <p>If site were generating broadcast content, it likely would lease space to one or more television networks.  Or, if the site managed its own broadcasting, it would still need a media and technology center.
  
  <p>As for hotel and luxury boxes, it is assumed that hotel rooms and suites would have a balcony which opened to the indoor event site.  It is also assumed that some amount of space would be reserved for general admission spectator viewing (like from promenades which overlook the indoor site).  Additionally, site could offer special VIP passes for hotel guests (among others) so that they could walk around the event floor as the competition was going on.  This would give them an up front and personal view of the action, and would be an additional source of revenue for the site.
  
  <p>Considering the sample site configurations shown above, hotel balconies, luxury suites, restaurants and promenades could wrap the sport complex on all sides (even on the side where outdoor driving range is shown - but for that side, viewing area would be built above the driving range).
  
  <p>Exact site configuration is left to the individual site owner.  And note, not every market has the exact same demands, so appropriate configuration for a given market is key.
</ul>

<div id="TechnologyAndInnovation" class="main-container city" style="display:none">
<p><B>Technology</B>

<ul>
<p>As we all know, technology infiltrates virtually all aspects of our lives, so it makes sense that this would also apply to 4 Sport Challenge.  The following are just a few areas where technology could be used to enhance the 4 Sport Challenge experience.

<ul>
  <li><a href="#TrainingAides">Training aides</a>
  <li><a href="#AutonomousVideoCapture">Autonomous video capture</a>
  <li><a href="#PerformanceAnalysis">Performance analysis</a>
  <li><a href="#NationalRanking4SportAthletes">National ranking of 4 sport athletes</a>  
  <li><a href="#AutomatedReferees">Automated referees</a>
  <li><a href="#DuelingRobots">Dueling robots</a>
</ul>

</ul>

<a name="TrainingAides">
<B>Training aides</B>
<ul>
  <p>Pickleball and Ping-Pong ball machines have been on the market for a while (see the following reviews: 
  <a href="https://atabletennisracket.com/ping-pong-ball-machine/">Ping-Pong</a> and 
  <a href="https://pickleballmate.com/best-pickleball-machines/">pickleball</a>).  Although the various machines are effective at what they do, there are ways to make them even better.
  
  <p>To achieve a truly effective robot practice partner, the robot must be able to interpret where the human opponent hits the ball, so the robot can deliver a return from that specific point on the court.   For example, if a human pickleball player hits the ball to the deep left portion of the court, that is where the robot should return the ball from.  The benefit is it gives the human player a more realistic experience not only with respect to return starting point, but also the timing of the robot return.  For example, a hard driven ball reaches the robot's hitting area much faster than say a lob.   This gives the human player a varied amount of time to reposition themselves on the court.  Absent such ability, the robot would have no alternative than to deliver a ball at a fixed rate every few seconds.  And a truly sophisticated robot brain would know the robot's current position on the court (when human opponent hits the ball), and thus can estimate the relative position the robot would be in when getting to the hitting area (this would determine whether the robot can make an aggressive/forceful return, or whether the robot should merely lob the ball back over the net).  And for the most realistic robot match play, the robot could even sense when the human player's return was a point winner (i.e., robot wouldn't have been able to return the ball at all).

  <p>To simulate robotic motion, either the robot ball machine needs to actually move, or, multiple ball machines throughout the field of play would be necessary (or some combination of both).  To determine landing area of human opponent's return, it is assumed that cameras will exist which can identify the speed, spin and trajectory of a return.

  <p>With these tech advancements, robot match characteristics can be categorized into skill levels, and training programs can be developed which help advance the human player's skill level.   For example, if the robot detects that the human player has trouble with deep backhand shots, such shots could be included with more frequency in a match.    
  
  <p>Another example of technology used as a training aide are golf simulators.  These allow for visualization of golf ball flight, as well as offering swing attributes like club head speed, ball speed, ball launch angle, ball spin, maximum shot height, and ball flight curve.  There also is software which can analyze your golf swing and make recommendations (and can reinforce appropriate technique or call attention when golf swing regresses).
  
  <p>And with all robotic and computer aided technology, there are tons of analytics which go hand in hand (e.g., national database of player rankings, virtual matches, player progress reporting - which could drive improvements to robot's player development algorithms, etc.).  The world is already moving in this direction, 4 Sport Challenge merely would benefit from something that is already happening.  
</ul>


<a name="AutonomousVideoCapture">
<B>Autonomous video capture</B>
<ul>
   <p>It is assumed that 4 Sport Challenge sites will have comprehensive video collection so that event matches, behind the scenes activity, and training sessions are all available for distribution.  To do this cost effectively, it is assumed that the majority of the cameras (if not all) will be unmanned. But, this doesn't imply that unmanned cameras are stationary.  It is expected that intelligent software will drive the unmanned cameras so that there is some amount of camera mobility, as well as automatic adjustment of camera angle and zoom when factoring in subject matter motion (e.g., automatic ball tracking for golf shots, or automatic tracking of a basketball player as they traverse the obstacle course).
</ul>


<a name="PerformanceAnalysis">
<B>Performance analysis</B>
<ul>
   <p>Analytics is already being incorporated into legacy professional sports.  Some of this exists to help professional teams assess players, but can also be used to improve player performance.  For example, analysis of video can be used to determine whether a player's jump shot has undergone a change.  Things like launch height, launch angle and ball rotation can be measured and compared factoring in final result (made or missed basket).  
   
   <p>Video/computer analysis can be used to measure and refine a person's golf swing.
   
   <p>For table tennis and pickleball, in game strategy can be analyzed to help players determine which are the most effective shots considering various match and point criteria.  For example, in pickleball, based on the skill level of a given opponent, when is the most effective time to attempt a drop shot.
   
   <p>It is expected that 4 Sport Challenge sites will have continuous (and autonomous) video capture, which means site owners can monetize the data collected by selling automated coaching services to its members.  This is not any different than what a human coach or trainer would do, but can be done with video collection and clever software at a fraction of the cost (which means the site owner has a higher profit margin). 
</ul>


<a name="NationalRanking4SportAthletes">
<B>National ranking of 4 sport athletes</B>
<ul>
   <p>With some of the technology described above, it would be possible to assess a person's skill in each of the 4 sports associated with 4 Sport Challenge.  This would be especially important when defining entry criteria for a 4 Sport Challenge event.  After all, athletic competitions are the most enjoyable when competitors are evenly matched.  For mature leagues (e.g., professional, collegiate or international), the competitors would be well known and have extensive match history.  However, for something new like 4 Sport Challenge, it would be likely that many participants would be first time competitors.
   
   <p>For pickleball and Ping-Pong, ball machines could be used to simulate match conditions.  Video capture of results could be analyzed automatically and translated into a score consistent with existing ranking systems for pickleball and Ping-Pong.
   
   <p>For golf, simulator technology could be used to assess t-shots and approach shots, and an indoor green could be used to assess shots from bunkers and rough, as well as putting.  It would be modestly easily for analytic software to estimate the golfer's handicap based on effectiveness of shots made.
   
   <p>Basketball skills are the easiest to assess - player merely needs to run through each of the 3 basketball skills (free throw shooting, 3-point shooting, and obstacle course).  Data collected from cameras would be able to record results automatically.
   
   <p>The benefit of using automated mechanism to capture and assess a player's skill is that it would be completely objective, would be cost effective (wouldn't require human interaction), and results could be stored on the cloud.  And when a player does enter sanctioned events, those results can be merged with that of automated skills assessment.
   
   <p>Training centers which offer automated skills assessment would see this as a profit center, and 4 sport athletes would have a modestly easy, quick (less than 2 hours) and objective way to measure and track their skill.  And note, some players might not have an opportunity to enter sanctioned events very often but may want to have their skills periodically reassessed.
</ul>


<a name="AutomatedReferees">
<B>Automated referees</B>
<ul>
   <p>Since it is assumed that 4 Sport Challenge events have comprehensive video capture, it is assumed that automated referee feature will exist.  For example, in pickleball, it should be fairly easy to determine whether a ball is in or out.  And in golf, it should be easy to tell whether a golfer inappropriately moved their golf ball.  In table tennis, automated referee should be able to detect a service violation, or when the ball is inappropriately touched by a player (e.g., perhaps the ball contacts a player's clothing before it is successfully returned).
   
   <p>When considering indoor golf, it is expected that the automated referee will instruct players as to where they should place their golf ball after a simulated drive or approach shot (e.g., exact spot would be signaled via red dot laser beam or something equivalent).
   
   <p>Automated referees should be more cost effective, should speed up play, and offer a higher degree of reliability and consistency.
</ul>


<a name="DuelingRobots">
<B>Dueling robots</B>
<ul>
  <p>The section above on ball machines is an example of how robotics can serve as a training aide.  But there is an even more interesting aspect of robotics when considering how this could be incorporated into the basketball obstacle course.  As part of the NBA skills challenge (which is part of All-Star weekend), there is a timed obstacle course where one of the skills involves passing a basketball to a fixed target.  But a more comprehensive assessment of a player's skill would involve passing a ball to a moving target, like when making a long pass to a player sprinting down the wing on a fast break.  Imagine a robot player sprinting toward the opposing basket where the human competitor has to rebound the ball, dribble around robot defenders, and pass the ball to his robot teammate to complete the fast break.

  <p>A sufficiently advanced robot defender would be able to anticipate the trajectory of a pass and move in such a way to intercept the ball, and would also have the ability to move their arms to deflect the pass.  Likewise, the robot offensive player would have the ability to adjust to the path of the ball and attempt to redirect the caught ball toward the goal.  The offensive robot could calculate the likelihood that the pass was caught (as opposed to going out of bounds), as well as the likelihood of a made basket.

  <p>This section is titled dueling robots not only because robots are used for both offense and defense, but also because multiple vendors might be showcasing their robots in the competition.  Although this might be considered science fiction to some, robots which have sufficiently powerful cameras and advanced computer programming should be able to handle the various complexities of player movement, dribbling, passing and ball trajectory (most of this is just math - albeit more complicated math than I can comprehend).  But autonomous driving cars already exist and are currently being tested in the real world, so robot basketball players seem like a modestly small subset of what is already going on right now.   Let's just hope those robots don't learn how to commit fouls - because that might hurt.  
</ul>

<div id="RealityTvAndBroadcasting" class="main-container city" style="display:none">
<p><B>Reality shows</B>

<ul>
<p>Although it is ultimately expected that 4 Sport Challenge will evolve into a professional sports league (and thus have its own broadcasts), even before this happens, there are numerous opportunities for reality TV shows.  Here are a few examples.

<ul>
  <li><a href="#Sites">Site construction, technology and design competitions</a>
  <li><a href="#FindingTheUltimate4SportAthlete">Finding the ultimate 4 sport athlete</a>
  <li><a href="#GameShowCompetitions">Game shows</a>
  <li><a href="#CelebrityChallenge">Celebrity challenge</a>  
</ul>
</ul>


<a name="Sites">
<B>Site construction, technology and design competitions</B>
<ul>
   <p>The premise behind this reality show is 4 Sport Challenge site construction and technology. It is expected that 4 Sport Challenge sites will be both innovative and culturally interesting, so as sites come online, there would likely be some amount of interest in seeing how they are built, as well as seeing how technology is integrated into the site.  Examples of shows which already focus on things like this are: Modern Marvels, Extreme Engineering, and Dirty Jobs.
   
   <p>Although new construction for 4 Sport Challenge sites is expected, there might be opportunities to re-purpose existing sites, so another aspect of this reality show could be to tour decaying structures throughout the country and present designs to re-imagine them.
   
   <p>The TV network most aligned with this would be Discovery Channel (including HGTV, Science Channel, etc.). 

   <p><img src="RealityTVShowsSiteConstruction.jpg" alt="Examples of existing reality shows focusing on construction">
   
   <p>And since Americans seem to like shows which have some sort of competitive aspect, design competitions can be incorporated into the construction and design of 4 Sport Challenge sites.  In fact, designs could be submitted from anyone throughout the country, with reality show experts selecting the best designs to be presented on the show.  It is expected that show experts and fans voting would determine the top designs.  Then, design teams which are ultimately selected can do the build out, and industry and show experts can judge the final result.  
   
   <p>Examples of shows which already focus on this are: Brother vs Brother and Rock The Block.
   
   <p><img src="RealityTVShowsDesignCompetitions.jpg" alt="Examples of existing reality shows focusing on design competition.">
</ul>


<a name="FindingTheUltimate4SportAthlete">
<B>Finding the ultimate 4 sport athlete</B>
<ul>
   <p>The premise behind this reality show is to find the best 4 sport athletes.
   
   <p>The most obvious strategy to accomplish this would be to host 4 Sport Challenge events throughout the country and identify a subset of athletes that have the highest degree of skill across all 4 disciplines.
   
   <p>Film crews could collect footage of local events and then submit edited content to be included on the reality show.  Highly skilled competitors in local 4 Sport Challenge events could be funneled into regional events, thus narrowing in on those that are truly elite in all 4 disciplines.  Elite 4 sport athletes could be invited to compete in a year end tournament, which would also be filmed and included in the reality show.
   
   <p>An added benefit of using local (perhaps even amateur) film crews for local and regional 4 Sport Challenge events is that it offers an opportunity for those starting out in the broadcast industry to gain experience and exposure.  And as 4 Sport Challenge becomes more mature, there will be jobs available for those skilled in broadcasting.  Those submitting high quality content from local events would be auditioning for later job opportunities.  In fact, best amateur video content could even be worked into a competitive aspect of the reality show itself.
   
   <p>Additionally, a small film crew could travel the country making stops at various colleges to seek out those that are interested in 4 Sport Challenge.  It isn't known which college sports would have the best 4 sport athletes, and it isn't even known what level of interest college administrators would have in this relatively new enterprise. As for college athletes, it is possible that those that are on golf teams might have an advantage, because golf probably takes the longest amount of time to master.  But those on college basketball, tennis, pickleball, and table tennis teams might have something to say about this, so they all can be interviewed, and interesting discussions can be aired on the reality show.
   
   <p>Aside from visiting colleges, traveling film crew could seek out any and all other venues where potential 4 sport athletes might be lurking.  These include:
   <ul>
      <li>Professional sports teams
	  <li>Training centers and clubs which focus on golf, pickleball, and table tennis
	  <li>Health clubs
   </ul>
   
   <p>These additional venues might actually want to partner in local 4 Sport Challenge events (for either profit, or for charitable reasons).

   <p>The television network most aligned seems to be <a href="https://www.golfchannel.com/">The Golf Channel</a>.
</ul>



<a name="GameShowCompetitions">
<B>Game show competitions</B>
<ul>
   <p>The premise behind game show is amateurs competing against 4 Sport Athletes for prize money.
   
   <ul>
      <p>Candidate contestants would register at an authorized training center.  Registration process would include a self-assessment, after which competitors would be asked to play against a robot (see training aides section under Technology and Innovation for more information).  Data collected using a robot practice partner would be highly efficient and would make video collection and submission fair, easy and consistent.
   	  
	  <p>On the show, a contestant would get an opportunity to compete against one of many different opponents.  The opponent could be another contestant, or a 4 sport athlete that is made available by the show (such an athlete could be a celebrity, a professional, or someone that coaches 4 sports athletes).  
	  
	  <p>The contestant would have the opportunity to select the skill level of their opponent.  Alternatively, opponents' skill level could be determined by contestant's ability to answer trivia questions.  The contestant could be rewarded for correct answers by increasing the prize money awarded, or by decreasing the skill level of the opponent they have to beat (thus increasing their odds of winning).

      <p>Aside from prize money, awards could be things like 4 Sport Challenge apparel, free tickets to a 4 Sport Challenge team event, team VIP perks, or season tickets for their favorite team.  Obviously, team awards imply that professional teams and sites have come into existence.	  
   </ul>
   
   <p>The good thing about 4 Sport Challenge is that all sports can be played indoors (even golf).  This will make the show's competitive aspect very consistent, and it won't be impacted by external factors like weather.  To ensure consistency of show duration, some limitations will need to be placed on the individual competitive events.
   
   <ul>
      <p>Pickleball and table tennis can be a single game - race to 8 (no win by 2).  And for pickleball, it is expected that points would be awarded on each rally (not just when serving).
	  
	  <p>Golf could be up to 3 holes (ties would be allowed).
	  
	  <p>Basketball events are modestly short, so they perhaps don't have to be trimmed down at all.  But if desired, 3-point shooting could reduce the number of shot attempts, and for free throws, the time could be reduced.  Another option would be to have contestant and opponent perform 3-point shooting and free throws in parallel (split screen).  The benefit of parallel competition is that sound effects (e.g., crowd noise) could be used to signal a successful basket, thus increasing tension level for the participants (and perhaps enhancing excitement for viewers). 
	  
	  <p>Basketball obstacle course would serve as the tie breaker if 3-point shooting and free throws are split by the participants.  If obstacle course competition is needed to break a tie, it is expected that would not be run in parallel.	  
   </ul>

   <p>Although 4 Sport Challenge isn't intended to be a competition between two individuals, invariably a celebrity or athlete is going to call out some other celebrity or athlete, and challenge them to a match. The problem is that 4 Sport Challenge isn't intended to reward 1 or 2 sport athletes, and if the participants aren't well skilled in all 4 disciplines, it could result in a 2-2 split, and that wouldn't really resolve which participant was truly the best 4 sport athlete.  When each competitor wins 2 of the 4 disciplines, the following can be used to break the tie:
   
   <ol>
     <li>Add total games won in pickleball and table tennis to the number of basketball sub-activites won.   Competitor with the higher number is the winner.
	 <li>Otherwise, if a competitor won golf match by more than 9 strokes, then that competitor is the winner.
	 <li>Otherwise, a playoff will decide the winner.  The playoff will be in one of the 4 disciplines (selected at random).  For golf, sudden death playoff described under Competitive Events will be used.  For pickleball and table tennis, a single game to 11 will decide the winner.  For basketball skills, one of the 3 sub-activities will be selected at random - winner of the sub-activity will be declared the winner.
	 <li>An alternative to random selection would be for the two competitors to mutually agree on a specific discipline.  This might occur if the two competitors were evenly matched in one of the disciplines.
   </ol>
   
   <p>If celebrity challenges were to take place, follow-up progress could be reported and rematches could be scheduled.  It is possible that exposing progress made by celebrities, including training regiment, might be interesting to viewers, and could inspire them to improve their skills.

<B>Individuals</B>
<ul>
    <p>It is expected that a 4 Sport Challenge event for individuals will consist of between 4 and 32 competitors.  

    <p>Events may be designated as female only, or open to all.

    <p>Individual competitors must participate in all 4 disciplines.

    <p>Within each discipline, the final results will rank the competitors from 1 thru N, where a competitor accumulates points for their relative position (e.g., winner of a discipline with 20 competitors will get a base score of 20 points, and will earn bonus points for coming in first, second place would earn 19 points and slightly less bonus points, etc.).

    <p>The total points accumulated across all 4 disciplines will decide the final standings.

    <p>Since the goal of 4 Sport Challenge is to recognize skill across all disciplines, additional bonus points will be awarded for competitors which win (or perform well) across multiple disciplines.   And the bonus points increase for competitors that perform well in all disciplines.  But bonus points will be subtracted for competitors which come in last (or in the bottom quartile) in a given discipline.

    <p>Each 4 Sport Challenge will start with a foot race of either 1 mile, 2 miles, or 5K.  The goal of the foot race is to demonstrate minimum fitness requirements (after all, pickleball and basketball skills require some amount of running).  But the time requirements will be relatively easy to meet (e.g., for open division, minimum mile time will likely be 9 minutes, and for other divisions, it will likely be 10 minutes).

    <p>For table tennis and pickleball, there will be a 2 round qualifying tournament which decides playoff seeding.  For modestly small events (e.g., 8-12 players), playoff would likely be 2 rounds consisting of semifinals and finals.  For larger events, a quarter final round can be introduced.  It is expected that qualifying round would seed players based on predetermined skill level so that top players don't eliminate each other. It is also expected that matches will be scheduled so that all players have roughly the same "strength of schedule".  To minimize tie break scenario for playoff consideration, total games won, and points won, will be factored into the scoring model.

    <p>Basketball skills:
    <ul>
        <li>Free throws made in 2 minutes (player must self-rebound and dribble beyond foul line).
		
        <li>3-point shooting contest - 90 seconds, 5 racks each containing 5 balls, international 3-point line is used, no gimmick shots exist (i.e., no "money ball" which has higher value).
		
        <li>Obstacle course (timed). 
		
        <li>Depending upon size of event, either top 4 or top 8 will advance to playoff round.  Playoff will be one more round with final ranking resulting from the performance of the playoff round only (performance in qualifying round won't carry over).  The overall ranking of competitors in basketball skills will consider the rankings in all 3 sub-activities where cumulative score will determine the final ranking.  For free throw and 3-point shooting, ties are allowed - competitors which have the exact same number of made baskets will merely share that relative position and will thus get awarded the same number of points.  If cumulative ranking across all 3 sub-activities results in a tie, timed result (to the millisecond) in obstacle course will break the tie. 
    </ul>
	
	<p>Golf
    <ul>
	    <li>Stoke play results will determine the overall ranking.  Extra holes may be played to determine a winner.   Aside from winner, ties are allowed - players with the very same score will be awarded the same number of points for their relative position.
    </ul>
</ul>









<a name="TeamEvents">
<B>Team events</B>
<ul>
    <p>4 Sport Challenge team events involve 2 separate teams which compete against each other.

    <p>A team consists of between 4 and 8 players (8 is ideal - at least for coed team events).  For the sake of this discussion, will focus on coed team event consisting of 4 men and 4 women.
	
	<p>For pickleball, Ping-Pong, and golf, there will be 5 matches:
    <ul>
        <li>Male singles
        <li>Female singles
        <li>Male doubles
        <li>Female doubles
        <li>Mixed doubles
    </ul>
	
    <p>For golf, match play rules will apply, and for doubles, alternate shot format will be used.  Extra holes may be played to break a tie, but to expedite event completion, a match can be decided by a chip shot closest to the pin.  Exact details for tie break are left to the discretion of the governing body hosting the event.

    <p>For basketball skills, player results will be ranked from 1 to N in each of the 3 separate skills, and then aggregate ranking score per team will decide the winner (lowest score wins each sub-category).  The 3 separate skills will be ranked individually - lowest aggregate score in 2 or more skills wins the basketball competition.  In the event of a tie, aggregate time for obstacle course will decide the winner.  
        
	<p>It is assumed that matches for all 4 sports will be completed.  The winner of a team event shall win at least 3 out of the 4 sports. If  each team wins 2 sports, the following tie break rules will decide the event winner:
    
    <ol>
       <li>Total matches won in pickleball, Ping-Pong and golf, plus number of basketball sub-categories won decides the winner.
       <li>Total number of games won in pickleball and Ping-Pong decides the winner.
       <li>Total holes won in golf decides the winner.
       <li>Aggregate time in basketball obstacle course decides the winner.
    </ol>
    
    <p>Events may be open, coed, or female only.  Males obviously may not compete in female only events, nor can a male compete in a coed match other than in the slot designated for a male.
    
    <p>Match rosters to be submitted by team captains at the start of the event (rosters are submitted in a sealed envelope).  Team captains can negotiate changes to match rosters, but absent mutual agreement, original blind submission should be followed.
</ul>


<a name="General">
<B>General</B>
<ul>
    <p>If 4 Sport Challenge event is to be completed in a single day, steps need to be taken to protect the health and well-being of the competitors.   For example, foot race might have to be completed at an earlier point in time. Additionally, table tennis and pickleball matches likely will need to be best of 3 (and not best of 5). And rounds of golf might have to be limited to 9 holes (instead of 18).

    <p>When attempting to complete an event in the shortest amount of time, it is assumed that concurrent play will be used to accomplish this.   And for table tennis and pickleball, if playoffs rounds are being held, it is assumed that players will be given adequate rest between playoff matches to keep competition as fair as possible.   One way to ensure fairness is to have all playoff matches in each round played at the same time, this way, no advancing player would have significantly more time to rest than others.   But some reasonable amount of recovery time should still be allowed, because not all matches will complete at the same time (even if they start at the same time).

    <p>Depending upon site configuration, it might be appropriate to have multiple disciplines being competed at the same time.   But as mentioned above, players health and safety must be taken into consideration, as well as overall fairness.   Therefore, breaks and recovery time for athletes must be considered.

    <p>It is assumed that all events will be captured on video, and when possible, matches should have a referee.  It is expected that technology would be available to resolve disputes (e.g., video replay), and better yet, cameras and software should be able to make calls automatically during live action.  It is expected that this technology will evolve over time, so 4 Sport Challenge events will need to continually adapt as technology improves.

<a name="Inclusiveness">
<B>Inclusiveness</B>
<ul>
    <p>First and foremost, 4 Sport Challenge was invented with the premise that it would be highly inclusive.  Fairness and justice are talked about quite a bit in the media, but for 4 Sport Challenge, it isn't a slogan or punchline, it is a fundamental core principle.  The 4 sports selected place a premium on skill and don't rely heavily on height, strength, speed or endurance.  Although elite athletes may do well in 4 Sport Challenge, there will be plenty of room for those that aren't elite athletes, but instead are highly skilled and highly determined.  And although women certainly can be elite athletes, at least with 4 Sport Challenge, it won't be a requirement, and as such, a greater percentage of women should be able to compete on par with their male counterparts.
    
    <p>One of the more exciting aspects is the coed team event (4 man / 4 women).  This blurs the distinction between male and female athletics, and instead places the focus on cooperation, collaboration, and teamwork.  This should also broaden the base of support regarding viewership.
    
    <p>Because there are 4 separate sports, training and dedication must be spread out across all four disciplines, so being the best of the best in any one sport is no longer a requirement.  With single sport competitions, if an athlete is struggling to be in the top tier, they might get discouraged, or might even be excluded altogether.  But with 4 distinct disciplines, it allows broader participation and at least gives athletes an opportunity to leverage the disciplines that they excel at while evolving their skills in areas that they are weaker.
    
    <p>Because of the nature of the 4 sports selected, advancing age should be less of a detriment.  Due to better diet and training, professional athletes are extending their careers longer than ever before.  Because skill is more important in 4 Sport Challenge, the average age of a top 4 sport athlete will likely be a bit higher than that of a typical professional athlete, and those advancing in age perhaps won't be pushed aside quite so easily.  

    <p>Three of the four sports are accessible to most - with golf being a bit more restrictive.   Unfortunately, golf is constrained by climate, availability of land, and in some respects, financial resources.   However, as golf simulators become more readily available, accessibility to golf will continue to rise.   And as technology improves, access to training through robotics, as well as coaching through video capture and sophisticated software, should allow everyone to get the practice and mentoring needed to be an outstanding 4 sport athlete.
    
    <p>And most of all, 4 Sport Challenge isn't intended to only be a professional event - it is expected that 4 Sport Challenge events will exist at the following levels:

    <ul>
       <li>High school
       <li>College
       <li>Recreational (i.e., local leagues based on skill level)
       <li>Virtual leagues (via robotics and golf simulators)
       <li>Amateur
       <li>Olympic / International
       <li>Professional
    </ul>
    
    <p>Although this perhaps goes without saying, elite 4 sport athletes aren't limited to those that are in basketball, golf, pickleball or Ping-Pong.  It is expected that competitors from football, baseball, hockey, among others, will compete quite favorably.   This is the exciting thing about 4 Sport Challenge - you never know where the top 4 sport athletes will come from (could even come from the coaching, management, or business sector).
</ul>


<a name="Popularity">

    <p>Basketball is basically everywhere in the U.S. (in all the schools, local parks, local gyms, and even in people's back yards) and has a huge media and professional footprint.  Golf, like basketball, is supported in many high schools, colleges and obviously, professionally.  Plus, most cities have numerous golf courses.  Pickleball is the <a href="https://usapickleball.org/news/fastest-growing-sport/">fastest growing</a> sport in the U.S.  And Ping-Pong is a game that many grew up playing, and most cities have Table Tennis clubs.   Plus, it is easy to put a table in your garage or basement.  Ping-Pong is not supported at the collegiate level quite the same as other sports, but there are still plenty of colleges that have Ping-Pong teams.
    
    <p>The bottom line is that the 4 sports selected are already very popular in the U.S., and many people play all of them.  Two out of the four sports have extensive media exposure (basketball and golf), and pickleball is getting more and more media coverage as its popularity grows.  It is only Ping-Pong which is lagging - but since it is a fun sport to play, it is expected that media attention surrounding Ping-Pong will increase as 4 Sport Challenge gets more exposure.  And as robotics and simulators get more advanced, it will be easier for people to train in these sports - thus increasing the enjoyment and popularity even more.
    
    <p>As for popularity across the globe, Ping-pong is more popular in Europe and Asia than in the U.S. (e.g., it is the national sport of China).  Golf and basketball are already very popular in Europe and are growing in Japan and China.  As pickleball becomes more popular in the U.S., its popularity throughout the world should grow as well (and is already growing).  Because 4 Sport Challenge is a green field (discussed below), its popularity throughout the world should be high since those in other countries won't be at a competitive disadvantage.  It took the world quite some time to catch up to the U.S. in basketball - but such a gap isn't quite as wide when it comes to the 4 sports in 4 Sport Challenge (well, assuming that there is a gap at all).
</ul>


<a name="GreenField">
<B>Green field</B>
<ul>
    <p>The term green field is used when discussing 4 Sport Challenge because there isn't an established league, and it isn't even an officially recognized event.  Although there are sites which support the individual sports and are even some sites which support up to 3 out of the 4 sports, there are no indoor sites which can support all 4 sports (indoor golf is the missing piece of the puzzle).  Because of this, new investment in facilities and sites, as well as improved technology, will be needed.  Because the space is brand new, it allows new investors to stake their claim.  The interesting thing about startups in the sports and entertainment industry is that there is a skeptical view from the old guard (e.g., the well-established sports leagues in the U.S.).  Typically, legacy businesses will keep an eye on startups, and when possible, will try to either own them entirely, or crush them completely.  Legacy leagues tend not to focus on startups for fear that it will detract from their existing lines of business.   But, once startups take root, legacy lines of business will be eager to get involved because they don't want to be left behind.
    
    <p>As an example, since pickleball is the fastest growing sport in the U.S., professional athletes are already starting to invest in professional pickleball (e.g., <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/sport/tom-brady-pickleball-intl-spt/index.html">Tom Brady</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/sport/lebron-james-pickleball-ownership-spt-intl/index.html">Lebron James</a>, among others, are recent investors</a>).  Of course, depending upon perspective, one could argue that investment by Tom Brady and Lebron James doesn't constitute new investors, but instead represents the old guard.  But certainly, investment by professional athletes isn't quite the same as the legacy teams in professional football, basketball, hockey and major league baseball.  Professional athletes have been attempting to enter ownership for quite a while, so it is very likely that if 4 Sport Challenge were to take off, there would be plenty of professional athletes eager to be part of ownership groups.  And in general, since 4 Sport Challenge is a green field, it is expected that a decent percentage of ownership will be from first time ownership groups.
    
    <p>The same can be said about women in professional sports (with respect to ownership) - the good news for women is that since 4 Sport Challenge is a green field, there will be plenty of opportunities across all aspects - as competitors, coaches, general managers, owners and in media/broadcasting.  And remember, since professional coed teams are expected, there is no reason why half the coaches, general managers, and owners couldn't be women.
    
    <p>And if 4 Sport Challenge does take off, there will be jobs at all levels for working class people (e.g., construction, broadcasting, event management, fitness, hospitality, sales and marketing, security, technology services, etc.).
</ul>


<a name="FitnessAndTrainingCenters">
<B>Fitness and Training Centers</B>
<ul>
    <p>Although sites which host 4 Sport Challenge events will evolve over time, it is expected that many sites will arise which offer training for golf, basketball, pickleball and Ping-Pong.   There are already numerous sites throughout the U.S. which offer two or more of the sports (as well as overall fitness training).  It is believed that these sites will compete for the business of training 4 sport athletes.  Additionally, it is believed that these sites will partner with traditional golf courses so that they can host 4 Sport Challenge events.
    
    <p>Over time, the notion of true indoor golf will become a reality.  At present, the simulator market is focusing on pure simulation (i.e., they are not focusing on indoor facilities which have one or more full size chipping and putting greens).  But once simulator technology is merged with sites that manage indoor chipping and putting greens, they will be able to offer a very realistic indoor golf experience.  Users will be able to play virtual golf on the most popular golf courses throughout the world and will be able to complete each hole on the site's indoor chipping and putting greens.  The software to merge approach shots to virtual hole with local site's indoor chipping and putting greens is not far off - and once offered, the indoor golf market will explode.  Companies like TopGolf and Drive Shack already support a partial golf experience - they just don't currently support indoor chipping/putting greens.  But as soon as one company offers this, the rest will follow (or will be left behind).
    
    <p>And once training centers exist which can host all sports within 4 Sport Challenge, the next step will be sites which allow spectator viewing (stadium seating, restaurants, hospitality, promenades, etc.).  The evolution of 4 Sport Challenge sites will take time - just as creation of coed teams will take time.  But the sites will follow the demand of both paying customers and spectators, and the 4 sport athletes will follow the money.
</ul>


<a name="Broadcasting">
<B>Broadcasting</B>
<ul>
    <p>Pickleball and Ping-Pong tournaments were commonly available on YouTube but were not available on traditional broadcast networks.  But as the popularity of pickleball grows, broadcast networks are starting to carry pickleball events.  One of the more enjoyable matches recently included PGA golfer's <a href="https://golf.com/news/jordan-spieth-scottie-scheffler-pickleball/">Jordan Spieth and Scottie Scheffler</a>.  This match showed how quickly professional athletes have gravitated to pickleball (note that match also included basketball legend Dirk Nowitzki and tennis player John Isner).
    
    <p>At present, ESPN and Golf Channel seem to be the best positioned to carry 4 Sport Challenge events (should they be interested in doing so).  But if they pass, there certainly are other networks waiting in line (e.g., CBS is starting to carry celebrity pickleball, and they already have a strong presence in golf). But aside from traditional broadcast networks, streaming services like Amazon Prime and Netflix would also have interest.  All content providers are looking for perpetual content which can serve as an anchor to protect and broaden their subscriber base.  The major sports leagues in the U.S. are a perfect anchor, which is why Amazon fought so hard to get NFL Thursday night football.  HGTV has already built a loyal following surrounding home renovation, but if they could parlay that support to include construction, design, and renovations of 4 Sport Challenge sites, they could grow their brand even more.  And again, if 4 Sport Challenge takes off, those not positioned well will be at a strategic disadvantage.
    
    <p>The other wild card is how quickly international interest develops.  Ping-Pong is already very strong in Europe, Japan and China (as is golf), and basketball is already strong in Europe, and is emerging in China and Japan.   So strong international interest in 4 Sport Challenge could potentially impact the U.S. broadcast market, which might impact the broadcast networks that take the lead.
    
    <p>It will be interesting to see whether pickleball as a standalone sport will carry enough broadcast interest.  The celebrity matches are  entertaining, but it is uncertain whether pickleball tournaments by themselves will hold mass viewer appeal.  The attraction of 4 Sport Challenge is that it builds upon the popularity of existing sports (golf and basketball), adds the up-and-coming sport of pickleball, and completes the skill set with Ping-Pong.
    
    <p>Of course, the major sports leagues in the U.S. will continue to dominate the landscape, but there perhaps is room for a new startup.  It is possible that some combination of sports will be necessary to gain traction - and 4 Sport Challenge seems to fit that niche quite well.  But golf is going through a transition period (e.g., <a href="https://www.livgolf.com/">LIV tour</a>), and there is so much competition for the leftovers after the major sports leagues have taken their market share.  4 Sport Challenge has a fighting chance because of its potential for events to be played completely indoors.  This allows spectators to enjoy all the matches from the comfort of their air-conditioned seats, all while enjoying their favorite snack foods and beverages.  
    
    <p>Fan loyalty for their home team and site allows merchants and service providers to form a solid relationship with the fan base (this is talked about more in the "Site Management" tab).  This should allow for a more entertaining and engaging experience for spectators, and perhaps a more profitable engagement for broadcast networks and business partners.
</ul>



<a name="ServiceProviders">
<B>Service Providers</B>
<ul>
    <p>There are all sorts of service providers, merchants, and business partners that will be associated with 4 Sport Challenge.   The following are just a few to consider:
    
    <ul>
       <li>Golf simulator companies (both hardware and software).
       <li>Those that supply and install synthetic chipping and putting greens.
       <li>Traditional golf courses.
       <li>PGA / LPGA teaching professionals.
       <li>Golf and racket equipment providers.
       <li>Sports apparel providers.
       <li>Food and hospitality providers.
       <li>Site management providers.
       <li>AI and other software services (e.g., facial recognition, automated referee, automated coaching, virtual match engagement, etc.).
    </ul>
    
    <p>The attractiveness of indoor (perhaps all day) events, and perhaps even multi day events, is that it affords merchants an opportunity to form a long-term relationship with the spectators.  The reason why pickleball is the fastest growing sport in the U.S. is because people like to play it.  And when people like to play a sport, they are more inclined to watch it.  And they are more likely to buy apparel and equipment associated with those sports.  And because 4 Sport Challenge is 4 different sports, it casts a modestly wide net of spectator interest, and thus allows merchants with slightly different agendas to all come together and serve the spectator community.
    
    <p>And companies that parlay the indoor site experience with secondary services which extend beyond the given 4 Sport Challenge event will be able to maximize revenue by having secondary relationships with the spectators. For example, training centers which support virtual matches can host consumer 4 Sport Challenge events that take many days, weeks, or months to complete.  With golf simulators, and with robotic pickleball and Ping-Pong ball machines, every day consumers can compete with others of similar skill set anywhere in the world.   Golf simulator companies are already doing this very thing for golf, so this really is nothing more than an extension of the very same idea, but with four sports instead of just one.  The problem with the pure golf simulator model is that the golf simulators are rather expensive for home use, and absent real chipping and putting greens, it isn't a true/full golf experience anyway.  Companies like Top Golf and Drive Shack have an opportunity to jump into this space, but unless they embrace full (real) chipping and putting greens, they probably won't get as much traction (and once others start supplying indoor chipping and putting greens, they will have to catch up or be left behind).  
    
    <p>But the key take away is that 4 Sport Challenge offers another way for service providers and merchants to form a long-term engagement with consumers.  And this engagement goes way beyond the typical spectator that might go to a movie, concert, or sporting event.   Those sites, merchants and service providers that figure out how to interactively engage with the spectators will have a leg up which should increase revenue and profitability.

    <p>The one variable with 4 Sport Challenge has always been indoor golf - until now, it was just a futuristic vision of what could be.  However, with Tiger Woods and Rory Mcllroy (among others) partnering with the PGA and <a href="https://www.tmrwsportsgroup.com">TMRW Sports</a>, true indoor golf will be here soon.
    
    <p>As per <a href="https://tglgolf.com/">TGL golf:</a>
    <ul>
        <p>The custom-built arena will combine a data-rich virtual course with a state-of-the-art short game complex. TGL will offer a high-tech, high-energy fan experience with fans sitting greenside.
        
        <p>The inaugural TGL season kicks off January 2024 with a 15-match regular season, followed by playoffs and championship match.
    </ul>
    
    <p>It will be interesting to see what is available with initial rollout, but regardless, it is certain that the features will evolve and improve as time goes on.  And once official standards are enacted, many builders and vendors will enter the space, and indoor golf will explode.  It is unknown how 4 Sport Challenge will fit into the mix, but it certainly will benefit from the advances in indoor golf technology.

<ul>
    <p>For any new business venture to flourish, there must be standards.  Absent standards, the internet wouldn't exist.   Without standards, golf wouldn't exist.  And without standards, professional sports leagues wouldn't exist.  The good news is that all the sports within 4 Sport Challenge already have a solid foundation of rules and standards, so those standards will be followed when possible.  But the one aspect of 4 Sport Challenge which is lacking standards is indoor golf.  Since indoor golf is in its infancy stage, it is rapidly changing and evolving.  This means that standards for indoor golf will need to evolve as well - especially as indoor site features and technology change.  However, the standards must exist from the very beginning or competitive events would be unfair.  And certainly, teams associated with different sites wouldn't be able to compete, because each of the respective sites might have different characteristics (giving the home team a potential unfair advantage).      
</ul>


<a name="GoverningBodiesInGolf">
<B>Governing bodies in Golf</B>
<ul>
    <p>Although standardization will naturally arise over time, there will certainly be independent governing bodies which will have slightly different rules.  This is a fact of life, so attempting to force everyone to follow the exact same set of rules will never work.   Even the internet, with all its standards, doesn't operate under a single language or operating system (and yet, it still operates in an amazingly effective way).  It is the governing body which certifies the winner of a competitive event, and when necessary, can strip away previously awarded titles if egregious offenses are uncovered.  
    
    The following are examples of governing bodies for golf:

<a name="IndoorGolfSiteRequirements">
<B>Indoor golf - site requirements</B>
<ul>
    <p>For the sake of this article, the term "indoor green" will refer to the green, rough, and sand bunkers.  Rules governing the act of putting will explicitly reference the term "green putting surface".

    <p>A given indoor site shall have one or more greens, where all the greens together would be referred to as the site's green complex. 

    <p>It can be assumed that the simulator software has full understanding of the characteristics of both the virtual course and site's  green complex.
    
    <p>The requirements expressed aren't intended to be comprehensive, nor are they absolute mandates.  Instead, they are presented as examples of things which need to be considered.  When traditional golf courses are used to host golf tournaments, there is no conflict of interest with respect to any specific golfer or team.  Because of this, the concept of a "fair golf course" speaks more to whether good golf shots are rewarded and bad shots are penalized.   In general, golfers merely want a golf course to be consistent and obvious (no hidden surprises) - such courses are considered "fair" by the players.
    
    <p>But with team golf, especially if teams ultimately own their own indoor golf facility, the notion of fairness takes on a slightly different meaning.  In that case, the biggest concern with regards to fairness is whether the home team has a competitive advantage because the site owner manipulates the characteristics of the site in a non-obvious way, and then shares those non-obvious features only with the home team.  Other professional sports leagues have strict standards to protect against such behavior, and with indoor golf, this will be even more important.
    
    <ol>
      <li><p>Number of greens in a green complex.
      
            <p><b>Goal:</b> Allow diverse playing experience which approximates as many real-world greens as possible.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Include as many indoor greens as possible (2-4 is recommended).
                <li>When multiple greens exist, have diversity of elevation, size, shape, contour, bunkers and rough.
            </ul>      
      
      <li><p>Maximum chipping distance must consider ceiling height.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> Offer as realistic a golf experience as possible.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The indoor site's overall green complex layout will dictate the maximum chipping distance that is possible.
                <li>Maximum chipping distance should factor in ceiling height (e.g., it would be inappropriate to allow a 40 yard chip but only have 30 feet of ceiling height).
                <li>The simulator software must be configured considering the indoor site's ceiling height (this is mentioned in simulator requirements below).
                <li>Although more ceiling height is always better, there are practical limits with respect to cost of ownership.  But a good rule of thumb would be .75 feet of ceiling height for every foot of chip shot.  If a site needed to support a 25 yard chip shot, that would require roughly 56 feet of ceiling height.
            </ul>      

      <li><p>Automated referee.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> Consistent enforcement of rules.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b> 
            <ul>
                <li>Hardware within the site should detects chip shots and bunker shots which go out of bounds (e.g., hit the ceiling).  Absent automated mechanism, this would be something which would be difficult to confirm (i.e., the human eye might not be able to detect this under all circumstances).
                <li>Over time, additional automated referee features should arise.
            </ul>      

      <li><p>Number of holes (i.e., cups) which exist on a given putting surface.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> Multiple holes on a putting green allows for more accurate mapping of player's shot to virtual hole.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>A single putting green shall contain multiple holes.
                <li>Holes will be strategically placed to offer diverse playability.  But care should be taken to avoid putting surface becoming overly cluttered.  The recommended number of holes is between 4 and 8 (depending upon the size and shape of the green). 
                <li>It is entirely possible that two players in a group will putt to different hole locations.  Therefore, 
                each hole on the putting surface will have a means of being covered up with a circle of turf so that other players in the group can chip and putt to their target hole without any interference.
                <li>Ideally each hole cut would have a mini "elevator" which rises and lowers the circular turf thus allowing unused holes on a green to be covered up automatically.
                <li>Given that each hole on the putting surface has turf which covers the hole, traditional flag stick mechanism wouldn't work.  Instead, the flag stick would require a base which is slightly smaller than the circumference of the hole.

            </ul>

      <li><p>Consistency of play on greens, rough and bunkers.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> Fairness dictates that playability be consistent across all greens.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>All putting surfaces within an indoor site must have the same stimpmeter rating.
                <li>All sand bunkers must have the same playability (e.g., same type of sand, same depth).
                <li>If the type of rough around a green varies at all (e.g., depth or thickness), it must be visually distinguishable (e.g., vary in color).  And this visual distinction must be consistent across all greens within the site.
                <li>Ideally the same vendor would be used across all sites governed by a sanctioning body.  This would promote the highest degree of consistency.
                <li>For team events, practice time will be afforded to the visiting team.  No changes or repairs may be made to the greens from the start of the practice period until the completion of the competitive event.
                <li>For team events, it is the responsibility of the site owner (and home team) to point out any worn areas within the indoor site.  Ideally, worn areas would be repaired in advance of a competitive event, but if not, adequate disclosure is essential.  To drive this point home, the site owner should configure simulation software such that it points out worn areas so that those hitting approach shots to the green can be reminded of this.
            </ul>      

      <li><p>Hydraulic jacks to change slope of green.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> Support adjustable slope of contoured greens to align with event skill level.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow for minor slope changes to greens within indoor site by jacking up or down sides of a given green.  If hydraulic jacks had a 1 degree variance, that would allow for 2 degrees of total slope change (i.e., could jack up 1 side, and lower the other side).
                <li>Any adjustment to the green slope must be done before the start of the practice period and may not be changed until the competitive event is completed.
            </ul>      

      <li><p>Crowd interaction (proximity to the action, separation between players and spectators, crowd noise).
      
            <p><b>Goal:</b> Promote fairness for home and road teams.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Spectators may be allowed on the event floor, but shall remain in designated viewing areas (e.g., perhaps behind ropes - much like an outdoor golf tournament).
                <li>Event managers and event referee are expected to manage crowd noise so that no team or player is negatively affected.
                <li>Site owner may not pump in distracting noise or music during critical junctures of a match.   And note, it is  possible that multiple matches are being played at the same time.
            </ul>    
    </ol>
</ul>

<a name="IndoorGolfSimulatorRequirementsRequirements">
<B>Indoor golf - simulator requirements</B>
<ol>
    <li><p>Certification of simulation software.
    
            <p><b>Goal:</b> Promote integrity.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>A competitive event may only use officially certified golf simulation software and hardware.
                <li>An up-to-date certificate must be presented prior to the start of a competitive event.
                <li>The full capabilities of the simulation software must be published and available to all.
                <li>The hardware and software must be verified before the start of an event and may not be altered once an event starts. 
                <li>If there is a hardware failure during a competitive event, the event must be suspended while the hardware is replaced or repaired.  Prior to the resumption of play, the adjusted hardware must be reconfirmed.
            </ul>

    <li><p>Predictability of results.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> A player should expect predictability of virtual golf shot result given well understood and published virtual course conditions.   The virtual course conditions must be expressed in a consistent way allowing all golfers to easily understand the hole setup and real time weather conditions.

            <p><b>Standard:</b>
  
            <ul>
                <li>The software will support multiple views of the virtual fairway and green which can be controlled by the player.  These views will not only be available from the main hitting display screen, but also on supplementary displays positioned in the hitting bay.  
                <li>Fairway and green undulation will be expressed visually with directional arrows and will use color to express severity of slope.
                <li>Speed of the virtual green will be available via stimpmeter rating and will be consistent throughout the entire green surface.  But even more importantly, the firmness of the green will be expressed via some standard rating.  This will allow the player to predict the amount of roll that might result on an approach shot.  With this knowledge, the player can adjust the ball flight and spin accordingly.
                <li>Fairway roll will be expressed via some standard rating.
                <li>Fairway and green rough height and type will be expressed visually on the simulator display screen with taller and thicker rough being distinguishable via color.
                <li>Competitive event can be played under real time weather conditions on the virtual course (implies real time conditions are available from the virtual course), can elect to simulate typical weather conditions in a fair and consistent way based on historical averages, or can elect to turn off weather conditions altogether.  This must be decided by the event sanctioning body prior to start of the event.  
                <li>The software shall allow site administrator to express special notes associated with the indoor greens.  This can be used for things like worn areas of turf that are deemed in-play, and areas that are under repair where relief will be given.  The software shall include visual clues on the screen display so that players hitting approach shots to the green can be aware of this.
                <li>The software shall allow player to view the indoor site green which is mapped to the virtual hole.
            </ul>

    <li><p>Tree lined fairways and greens.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> When a player hits to an area which is guarded by trees, there must be a reasonable understanding of the relative risk of obstruction, including balls that may be unplayable. The player must have a reasonable expectation that a ball played from within the trees can be advanced into the fairway or onto the green, assuming a quality shot is executed.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
  
            <ul>
                <li>The relative risk (via published percentages) should be available via some visual clue as the player views the entire fairway.  This will inform the player of areas which border the fairway that should be feared, and which are safer.
                <li>When hitting from within the trees, the player must be able to control the simulator display screen adjusting the target reference point by 360 degrees.  This is because the player may have to advance the ball backwards, forwards, or sideways.
                <li>Simulator must consider whether player is right-handed or left-handed.  Based on player's stance when addressing the ball in the hitting bay, the software shall determine whether there is adequate room amongst the virtual trees for the player to complete the golf swing.  And obviously, if the player is attempting to stand where a tree is located, the software should make it obvious that this is not valid.
                <li>The simulator screen display must automatically adjust the depth of field (e.g., zoom in) so that trees in close proximity are shown.  This will allow player to establish a target point for hitting back into the fairway or onto the green.
                <li>If software isn't sufficiently advanced to model actual trees on a given course, a random sample of trees can be included to offer a bit of a challenge to the golfer, while still keeping things fair.  But the same principle applies as mentioned above.
                <li>And obviously, all hazards and out of bounds must be clearly delineated.
            </ul>
    
    <li><p>Mapping of golf shot on virtual hole to indoor site's chipping and putting green.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> The player's actual shot on the virtual hole should be mapped to the site's physical hole such that placement of the ball on the physical indoor green matches the difficulty of shot the player would have if they were actually playing on the virtual hole.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
  
            <ul>
                <li>To position the player's ball appropriately on the physical green, the software must understand the characteristics of both the virtual hole and the indoor site's physical green.  
                <li>The software shall position the player's ball such that it gives the player roughly the same playability as what they would experience if they completed the hole on the virtual course.  For example, a shot to the left of a virtual green might result in a chip shot to a downhill slope, but on the indoor green, a similar shot might be on the right side of the green.
                <li>The software must take into consideration the number and location of all holes on the putting service and pick the hole which is most appropriate.
                <li>Additional factors that might need to be considered are elevation of the virtual green (how high is the virtual green in relation to the fairway), rough height, and rough type.
                <li>Ideally, indoor golf solution would direct ball placement on indoor green via red dot laser beam.  As an alternative, match referee can assist with ball placement by approximating location based on data from simulator shot result.
                <li>The software must take into consideration whether the player is right-handed or left-handed.  This could impact things like:
                   <ul>
                      <li>stance, when golf ball is close to the right or left edge of a bunker on the virtual hole,
                      <li>uphill or downhill putts on virtual hole - e.g., right-handed golfers may have more trouble with downhill puts with left to right break (as opposed to right to left break).
                   </ul>
                <li>The software must understand the physical limitations of the indoor site - specifically the maximum ceiling height.  The software must not position the player's ball on the indoor green in a location which exceeds the maximum chipping distance.  Instead, the simulator must require the player to hit another approach shot to the green.                
            </ul>
        </ul>
  
      <li><p>Indoor sites with multiple greens of varying shape and contours.
      
            <p>For this requirement, it assumes the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Indoor site has multiple greens of varying elevation, size, and contours.
                <li>The rationale behind indoor green diversity is it allows for closer match with the diversity of holes in the real world.
                <li>Tee shot and approach are completed from simulator driving bay for as many greens as exist in the indoor site
                    (e.g., if there are 4 indoor greens, all shots from driving bay are completed for 4 virtual holes, and then the players walk the 4 greens completing the holes in sequential order 1 thru 4).
                <li>The rationale for completing holes this way is it speeds up play, while also allowing match of virtual hole characteristics with similar green within the indoor site.
            </ul>
      
            <p><b>Goal:</b> Mapping of virtual course green to similarly sized and contoured green within the indoor site more closely mimics virtual course experience.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
  
            <ul>
                <li>The golf simulator will order holes played on the virtual course such that they align with indoor site's green complex.
            </ul>
        </ul>            
  
    <li><p>Bunker shot - ball placement.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> Ball placement in the indoor bunker should match that of the lie on the virtual hole.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
  
            <ul>
                <li>The software will approximate the expected lie in the virtual bunker based on the shot trajectory (e.g., high shots which land directly in the bunker will have more of a buried lie than to balls that roll into the bunker).
                <li>The software will instruct placement in the bunker as follows: 75% buried, 50% buried, 25% buried, 0% buried.
            </ul>
  
    <li><p>Rough shot - ball placement.

            <p><b>Goal:</b> Ball placement on the indoor green's rough, or when hitting an approach shot from simulator turf, will approximate lie on virtual hole.
  
            <p><b>Standard:</b>
  
            <ul>
                <li>The software will approximate the expected lie in the rough based on shot trajectory and rough type.
                <li>The software will instruct placement in rough (either on indoor green, or on simulator hitting mat) such that it approximates lie on the virtual hole.  But unlike bunker shots, placement in the rough will either be dropped from waste high or placed gently (the premise is that dropped balls will likely result in a deeper and more difficult lie).
            </ul>

    <li><p>Confirmation of virtual shot and mapping to indoor green
  
            <p><b>Goal:</b> Promote consistency, validity and transparency

            <p><b>Standard:</b>
  
            <ul>
                <li>The simulator software shall present meta data regarding the shot and will allow an examination of the  details which directly contributed to the virtual shot result, as well as details which contributed to the mapping of virtual shot to the indoor green.
                <li>The simulator software shall be able to replay the virtual shot to confirm result is repeatable.
                <li>Replay results won't apply for things which included randomization.  For example, a ball hit into trees will likely require some randomization in regard to how the ball will react to tree limbs.  This is because simulation software won't have a perfect representation of all trees and other hazards, and the accuracy of carry and direction of ball flight will never be perfect.  This is why it is mentioned above that simulator must express the relative risk of hitting into various areas of a fairway or green which are guarded by trees.
            </ul>

<p><B>Press Release</B>
<ul>
  <p>Since 4 Sport Challenge is new, and considering inclusiveness is one of its fundamental principles, the manner in which 4 Sport Challenge is exposed to the general public needs to be carefully managed.  Although those in media often talk about social justice and fairness, there is one aspect of fairness and inclusiveness which is often overlooked - and that has to do with the fact that  media empires have a huge voice which can obscure the voice of individuals.  Therefore, it is important for the announcement of 4 Sport Challenge to reach all those that are interested at the very same time.  Otherwise, the rich and powerful within the sports and entertainment industry might hoard all the prime markets and teams, leaving smaller investors on the outside.

  <p>To accomplish this, major TV networks will be contacted so that they can disseminate information about 4 Sport Challenge in a fair and uniform manner.  Additionally, each of the following professional leagues will be contacted via email:
  
  <ul>
     <li>Players Association for NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball
     <li>PGA / LPGA
     <li>Professional Pickleball Association
     <li>USA Table Tennis
  </ul>

  <p>Separate press release for International 4 Sport Challenge will occur at a later date.

  <p><b>Statement to the press - February 17th, 2023</b>
  <ul>
    <p>This is the official announcement of a new sporting event known as 4 Sport Challenge.  The tabs at the top of this page can be viewed to get a better understanding of what 4 Sport Challenge is about.
  
    <p><b>Summary</b>
    <ul>
      4 Sport Challenge is a highly inclusive athletic competition which places a premium on skill, while minimizing physical attributes like height, strength, speed and endurance. And because 4 Sport Challenge is a green field, participation won't be limited to only professional athletes. The 4 sports selected (PickleBall, Ping-Pong, Golf and Basketball skills) are a balance of individual sports and those played against an opponent.
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Site management</b>
    <ul>
      This tab offers a vision of the sites which can host 4 Sport Challenge events.  Although legacy sites can perhaps host 4 Sport Challenge events right now, it is expected that new purpose-built sites will come online which are optimized for spectator enjoyment and engagement.
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Technology and Innovation</b>
    <ul>  
      This is a tiny glimpse into some possible technology which will be associated with 4 Sport Challenge sites and events.
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Reality TV and Broadcasting</b>
    <ul>  
      Although it is ultimately expected that 4 Sport Challenge will evolve into a professional sports league (and thus have its own broadcasts), even before this happens, there are numerous opportunities for reality TV shows.
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Competitive events</b>
    <ul>  
      Explains the rules associated with competitive events (e.g., tournament for individuals, team events, co-ed events, scoring model).
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Why now?</b>
    <ul>  
      Attempts to explain why 4 Sport Challenge is well aligned with industry and market trends.
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Standards</b>
    <ul>  
      Since indoor golf will ultimately be a part of 4 Sport Challenge, and since there are no published standards for indoor golf, it is essential to get the ball rolling on standards.   This is what will allow various ownership groups to begin constructing sites which host 4 Sport Challenge events.
    </ul>
