<B>Coming soon</B>

<ul>
<p>A highly inclusive athletic competition which places a premium on skill, while minimizing physical attributes like height, strength, speed and endurance.  And because 4 Sport Challenge is a green field, participation won't be limited to only professional athletes.  But in the spirit of inclusiveness, they too are welcome.
</ul>

  <p>To be included in 4 Sport Challenge, the sport shouldn't offer an advantage to someone that is tall, extremely fast, overly strong, or has an abundance of endurance.  Yes, some amount of speed is a benefit in pickleball and basketball skills.  But, the premise behind 4 Sport Challenge is that outstanding skill can make up for a lack of top end speed and other physical attributes.  For example, pickleball was selected over tennis because the court is smaller, and the rules surrounding serving lesson the advantage of being tall and fast (in pickleball, serve must be underhand, and server may not attack the service return - so serve and volley is off the table).
  
  <p>Because of the nature of 4 Sport Challenge, it is expected that women will be able to compete on par with men - that is why the open division is for both men and women.  But if there is a desire for a division dedicated exclusively to women, that too is fine.  If 4 Sport Challenge is adopted by the NCAA, there are Title 9 considerations that might necessitate that anyway.  As for team events, it is expected that there would be an open division and a co-ed division. Team event dedicated exclusively to women is also a possibility.  

<a name="BasketBallSkills">
<p><B>Basketball skills</B> - consists of 3 separate activities:
<ul>
  <li>Free throw shooting - 2 minutes (competitor must "self-rebound").
  <li>3-point shooting - 90 seconds (international distance, 5 racks, all shots count as 1 point).
  <li>Obstacle course - timed.
</ul>

<a name="Golf">
<p><B>Golf</B>
<ul>
  <li>Traditional outdoor courses will be used for some events.
  <li>Indoor driving range and synthetic chipping and putting greens expected in the future.
  <li>Traditional golf rules apply to all competitors.
</ul>  

<a name="Pickleball">
<p><B>Pickleball</B> - to ensure matches don't run long:
<ul>
  <li>Points are awarded on every rally, not just when serving.
  <li><a href="https://www.tabletennis365.com/Barnets/Pages/Expedite_Rule">Expedited time rules apply.</a>
  <li>Deuce games end at 16 points (16-15 wins).
</ul>

<a name="BusinessAndTechnology">
<p><B>Business and technology</B>
<ul>
   <li><a href="FourSportChallengeSites.html">Site management</a> - not only is there a need for physical sites to host 4 Sport Challenge events, it is expected that hospitality, health and fitness, broadcast and media centers, technology hubs and retail sales will be bundled within sites.
   
   <li><a href="FourSportChallengeTech.html">Robotics, video parsing, analytics and A.I.</a>
   will be used in conjunction with 4 Sport Challenge events. Vendors which offer such technology are good candidates for advertising revenue and as business partners.
   
   <li>Professional athletes may want to participate as competitors in 4 Sport Challenge events, but also may make good business partners, including investing in, or owning, 4 Sport Challenge sites.
   
   <li>Colleges (and NCAA) are also good candidates for business partners - they already manage stadiums and arenas, so they likely will see this as an additional revenue stream with minimal investment (a 4 Sport Challenge site would be a fraction of the cost to build as compared to a typical basketball arena).
   
   <li><a href="FourSportChallengeSitesRealityTV.html">Traditional broadcast networks</a> - reasons should be self-evident.  Plus, there are numerous reality show spins-offs that can be easily imagined.
   
   <li>4 Sport Challenge versus 4 League Challenge (NFL, NBA, NHL, and Major League Baseball) - it would be intriguing to see which league boasts the best 4 Sport athletes.  And once that is settled, it would be interesting to see how those 4 league athletes compare against the best 4 Sport athletes in the world.  Imagine 4 League Challenge / 4 Sport Challenge "Superbowl" the day before and after Baseball's All-Star game.   That would be must see TV. 
   
   <li>International interest - hard to say?  Table tennis is more popular outside the United States, and since 4 Sport Challenge is a green field, it  might attract quite a bit of international interest.  With existing professional sport leagues in the U.S., if a foreign athlete is highly skilled, they come to the U.S. to complete.  This benefits the foreign athlete and the U.S. team owners, but does little or nothing for the athlete's home country.  And the cost of entry for a 4 Sport Challenge site would be a fraction of that for a franchise in any of the big 4 U.S. sports leagues (plus, opportunities to buy a franchise are few and far between). 
   
   <li>4 Sport Challenge as an Olympic event - if 4 Sport Challenge were to take off, then this would actually make a lot of sense.  But this won't happen any time soon, and point above about international interest is key.
   
   <li>4 Sport Challenge sites have a fair amount of overlap with sites used as <a href="http://mrdmadison.github.io/Test1/MakeAmericaSafer/PublicSafetyApp.TestCenters.html">public safety test centers</a>, so partnerships with vendors offering <a href="http://mrdmadison.github.io/Test1/MakeAmericaSafer/PublicSafetyApp.GovernmentSummary">public safety applications</a> seem like a natural fit.
