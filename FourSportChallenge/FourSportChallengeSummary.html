<ul>
<p>A highly inclusive athletic competition which places a premium on skill, while minimizing physical attributes like height, strength, speed and endurance.  And because 4 Sport Challenge is a green field, participation won't be limited to only professional athletes.  But in the spirit of inclusiveness, they too are welcome.
</ul>

<B>Athletic disciplines</B>
<ul>
  <p><B>Basketball skills</B> - separate timed activities:  free throw shooting â€“ competitor must self-rebound, 3-point shooting, and obstacle course.

  <p><B>Golf</B> - Traditional outdoor courses at first, with indoor driving range and synthetic chipping and putting greens expected in the future.

  <p><B>Pickleball</B> - Selected over tennis because of inclusiveness considerations (e.g., smaller court size, under hand service rule which prohibits serve and volley).

  <p><B>Table tennis</B>
</ul>  


<a name="BusinessAndTechnology">
<p><B>Business and technology</B>
<ul>
   <p>Site management - not only is there a need for physical sites to host 4 Sport Challenge events, it is expected that hospitality, health and fitness, broadcast and media centers, technology hubs and retail sales will be bundled within sites.
   
   <p>Robotics, video parsing, analytics and A.I. will be used in conjunction with 4 Sport Challenge events. Vendors which offer such technology are good candidates for advertising revenue and as business partners.
   
   <p>Professional athletes may want to participate as competitors in 4 Sport Challenge events, but also may make good business partners, including investing in, or owning, 4 Sport Challenge sites.
   
   <p>Colleges (and NCAA) are also good candidates for business partners - they already manage stadiums and arenas, so they likely will see this as an additional revenue stream with minimal investment (a 4 Sport Challenge site would be a fraction of the cost to build as compared to a typical basketball arena).
   
   <p>Traditional broadcast networks - reasons should be self-evident.  Plus, there are numerous reality show spins-offs that can be easily imagined.
   
   <p>Imagine 4 Sport Challenge / 4 League Challenge (NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB) Superbowl the day before and after Baseball's All-Star game. That would be must see TV.
   
   <p>International interest - hard to say?  Table tennis is more popular outside the United States, and since 4 Sport Challenge is a green field, it  might attract quite a bit of international interest.  With existing professional sport leagues in the U.S., if a foreign athlete is highly skilled, they come to the U.S. to compete.  This benefits the foreign athlete and the U.S. team owners, but does little or nothing for the athlete's home country.  And the cost of entry for a 4 Sport Challenge site would be a fraction of that for a franchise in any of the big 4 U.S. sports leagues (plus, opportunities to buy a franchise are few and far between). 
   
   <p>4 Sport Challenge as an Olympic event - if 4 Sport Challenge were to take off, then this would actually make a lot of sense.   
</ul>

<div id="SiteManagement" class="main-container city" style="display:none">
<p><B>Site management</B>

<ul>
<p>The foundation of 4 Sport Challenge is the site where 4 Sport Challenge events are hosted.  Although 4 Sport Challenge events could be hosted at existing sites (at traditional golf courses, and basketball, pickleball and table tennis centers), it is expected that specialized 4 Sport Challenge sites will arise so that competition can be hosted within a single indoor site.

</ul>

<a name="SiteOverview">
<B>Site overview</B>
<ul>
  <p>Since 4 Sport Challenge is in the conceptual phase of development, and considering there are no official blueprints pending construction, the following vision expresses the possibility of what 4 Sport Challenge sites could be.  It is impossible to know how much of this vision will be integrated in initial sites, but over time, site features and scope will grow and evolve.  The goal is to express minimum requirements and let sites evolve into as grand a vision as humanly possible.  If it can be imagined, it can be built, so let the possibilities be endless.

  <p>The first premise behind 4 Sport Challenge is that events can be hosted entirely indoors.  But this doesn't preclude traditional golf courses from having a role in 4 Sport Challenge events.  For example, qualifying rounds of golf could be played on a traditional outdoor course - that would allow for a larger field of competitors.  But if outdoor golf is integrated with a 4 Sport Challenge event, it is expected that the championship round of golf be held within the indoor site.
</ul>

<a name="GolfFacility">
<B>Golf facility</B>
<ul>
  <p>To support indoor golf, at a minimum there would need to be a full size putting green and chipping area (including at least one front side sand bunker).  It is expected that chip shots of at least 20 yards would be possible. Of course, more than one green would be preferred, because this would allow for a more diverse and challenging golf experience.  Plus, with larger indoor facility, it would allow for more spectator viewing.
  
  <p>The other aspect which is essential for indoor golf is a driving range (needed for tee shot and approach shots to the green).  For small facilities, golf simulators could be used. But for a more realistic golf experience, an outdoor driving range can be integrated with the indoor site.  Imagine a tee box which is within the indoor site where the golfer hits directly to the outdoor driving range. After shot is completed (i.e., hit to outdoor driving range), automated software would predict where on the green the ball would come to rest. Note that golf simulation software allows for play on many different virtual courses, so final ball resting place would vary based on actual shot result when factoring in the shape and contours of the given virtual green.  Player would then place the ball on the indoor green as instructed by the golf simulation software (e.g., perhaps a red dot laser would mark the spot where ball should be placed) and complete the hole on the indoor green.  When hitting to a virtual green in the outdoor driving range, it is expected that clever use of lighting would allow for shading of the simulated green so that the player would have a realistic view of their target (which would include flag location, trees, water hazard, bunkers and rough). 
  
  <p><img src="SiteOverview_images.jpg" alt="4 sport home">

  <p>Shown above are some examples of sites which could theoretically be integrated with a 4 Sport Challenge sporting event (this is for illustrative purposes only, these are not truly 4 Sport Challenge sites).  See section below for discussion on how pickleball courts, table tennis center and basketball skills can be integrated into the event competition area.
</ul>

<a name="BasketballPickleballAndTabbleTennis">
<B>Basketball, pickleball and table tennis</B>
<ul>
  <p>Indoor golf will likely take up the most amount of space - well, depending upon the number of indoor greens.   However, it would be possible to combine pickleball, basketball and table tennis into the indoor golf course layout.  This would maximize use of floor space, but perhaps would limit concurrent use of the space for all 4 sports.  Optimum use of space would be to put 4 greens in the 4 corners of a rectangular shaped gym, and then include space for the other 3 sports in the middle.  
  
  <p>A key takeaway for sites which host 4 Sport Challenge events is that the scale of a site can vary greatly.  The use of golf simulators or outdoor driving range can drastically reduce the amount of indoor space that is needed.  Space can also be reduced by limiting the number of pickleball courts and golf greens, or by making space multi-function (e.g., pickleball courts can share the same floor space as basketball).  But larger indoor sites will be able to support more competitors without increasing the time it takes to complete a 4 Sport Challenge event.  And with larger sites, it is expected that more spectators would be able to attend an event. Likewise, if a site operates as a retail training centers, more indoor space would allow for more paying customers.
  
  <p>The following is a sample configuration for an indoor facility which has 4 separate golf greens.  Drives and approach shots can either be hit using golf simulator technology, or optionally could be hit to an outdoor driving range (e.g., similar to TopGolf).  In addition to golf, site also supports basketball court, table tennis and pickleball.   
  
  <p><img src="IndoorGolf4GreensWithBasketballAndPickleball.jpg" alt="4 indoor greens">
 
  <p>A slightly smaller option supports only 2 golf greens.  And for this configuration, pickleball and table tennis would have to share the same space with basketball.  
  
  <p><img src="IndoorGolf2GreensWithBasketballAndPickleball.jpg" alt="4 indoor greens">
 
  <p>An even smaller option supports only 1 golf green with pickleball and table tennis sharing space with basketball.  
  
  <p><img src="IndoorGolf1GreenWithBasketballAndPickleball.jpg" alt="4 indoor greens"> 
</ul>


<a name="RevenueGeneratingServices">
<B>Revenue generating services</B>
<ul>
  <p>The two most obvious sources of revenue for sporting events is broadcasting and spectator ticket sales.  But if site also includes hotel, restaurant, health and fitness, and retail sales, it can maximize revenue.  Plus, having guests stay for an extended period of time allows site to maximize revenue from each guest.  
  
  <p>Assuming a given site isn't fully booked with 4 Sport Challenge events, it can be utilized as a training center for paying customers that want to train in one or more of the 4 sports.  Health and fitness is big business, and if specialized instruction were available, it might give site owners a leg up on their competition (e.g., imagine potential revenue if a 4 Sport competitor also served as a coach for paying guests).
  
  <p>Site owners could lease space to corporate sponsors and external vendors, including retail space for things like 4 Sport Challenge equipment and apparel.
  
  <p>If site were generating broadcast content, it likely would lease space to one or more television networks.  Or, if the site managed its own broadcasting, it would still need a media and technology center.
  
  <p>As for hotel and luxury boxes, it is assumed that hotel rooms and suites would have a balcony which opened to the indoor event site.  It is also assumed that some amount of space would be reserved for general admission spectator viewing (like from promenades which overlook the indoor site).  Additionally, site could offer special VIP passes for hotel guests (among others) so that they could walk around the event floor as the competition was going on.  This would give them an up front and personal view of the action, and would be an additional source of revenue for the site.
  
  <p>Considering the sample site configurations shown above, hotel balconies, luxury suites, restaurants and promenades could wrap the sport complex on all sides (even on the side where outdoor driving range is shown - but for that side, viewing area would be built above the driving range).
  
  <p>Exact site configuration is left to the individual site owner.  And note, not every market has the exact same demands, so appropriate configuration for a given market is key.
</ul>

<div id="TechnologyAndInnovation" class="main-container city" style="display:none">
<p><B>Technology</B>

<ul>
<p>As we all know, technology infiltrates virtually all aspects of our lives, so it makes sense that this would also apply to 4 Sport Challenge.  The following are just a few areas where technology could be used to enhance the 4 Sport Challenge experience.

<ul>
  <li><a href="#TrainingAides">Training aides</a>
  <li><a href="#AutonomousVideoCapture">Autonomous video capture</a>
  <li><a href="#PerformanceAnalysis">Performance analysis</a>
  <li><a href="#AutomatedReferees">Automated referees</a>
  <li><a href="#DuelingRobots">Dueling robots</a>
</ul>

</ul>

<a name="TrainingAides">
<B>Training aides</B>
<ul>
  <p>Pickleball and Ping-Pong ball machines have been on the market for a while (see the following reviews: 
  <a href="https://atabletennisracket.com/ping-pong-ball-machine/">Ping-Pong</a> and 
  <a href="https://pickleballmate.com/best-pickleball-machines/">pickleball</a>).  Although the various machines are effective at what they do, there are ways to make them even better.
  
  <p>To achieve a truly effective robot practice partner, the robot must be able to interpret where the human opponent hits the ball, so the robot can deliver a return from that specific point on the court.   For example, if a human pickleball player hits the ball to the deep left portion of the court, that is where the robot should return the ball from.  The benefit is it gives the human player a more realistic experience not only with respect to return starting point, but also the timing of the robot return.  For example, a hard driven ball reaches the robot's hitting area much faster than say a lob.   This gives the human player a varied amount of time to reposition themselves on the court.  Absent such ability, the robot would have no alternative than to deliver a ball at a fixed rate every few seconds.  And a truly sophisticated robot brain would know the robot's current position on the court (when human opponent hits the ball), and thus can estimate the relative position the robot would be in when getting to the hitting area (this would determine whether the robot can make an aggressive/forceful return, or whether the robot should merely lob the ball back over the net).  And for the most realistic robot match play, the robot could even sense when the human player's return was a point winner (i.e., robot wouldn't have been able to return the ball at all).

  <p>To simulate robotic motion, either the robot ball machine needs to actually move, or, multiple ball machines throughout the field of play would be necessary (or some combination of both).  To determine landing area of human opponent's return, it is assumed that cameras will exist which can identify the speed, spin and trajectory of a return.

  <p>With these tech advancements, robot match characteristics can be categorized into skill levels, and training programs can be developed which help advance the human player's skill level.   For example, if the robot detects that the human player has trouble with deep backhand shots, such shots could be included with more frequency in a match.    
  
  <p>Another example of technology used as a training aide are golf simulators.  These allow for visualization of golf ball flight, as well as offering swing attributes like club head speed, ball speed, ball launch angle, ball spin, maximum shot height, and ball flight curve.  There also is software which can analyze your golf swing and make recommendations (and can reinforce appropriate technique or call attention when golf swing regresses).
  
  <p>And with all robotic and computer aided technology, there are tons of analytics which go hand in hand (e.g., national database of player rankings, virtual matches, player progress reporting - which could drive improvements to robot's player development algorithms, etc.).  The world is already moving in this direction, 4 Sport Challenge merely would benefit from something that is already happening.  
</ul>


<a name="AutonomousVideoCapture">
<B>Autonomous video capture</B>
<ul>
   <p>It is assumed that 4 Sport Challenge sites will have comprehensive video collection so that event matches, behind the scenes activity, and training sessions are all available for distribution.  To do this cost effectively, it is assumed that the majority of the cameras (if not all) will be unmanned. But, this doesn't imply that unmanned cameras are stationary.  It is expected that intelligent software will drive the unmanned cameras so that there is some amount of camera mobility, as well as automatic adjustment of camera angle and zoom when factoring in subject matter motion (e.g., automatic ball tracking for golf shots, or automatic tracking of a basketball player as they traverse the obstacle course).
</ul>


<a name="PerformanceAnalysis">
<B>Performance analysis</B>
<ul>
   <p>Analytics is already being incorporated into legacy professional sports.  Some of this exists to help professional teams assess players, but can also be used to improve player performance.  For example, analysis of video can be used to determine whether a player's jump shot has undergone a change.  Things like launch height, launch angle and ball rotation can be measured and compared factoring in final result (made or missed basket).  
   
   <p>Video/computer analysis can be used to measure and refine a person's golf swing.
   
   <p>For table tennis and pickleball, in game strategy can be analyzed to help players determine which are the most effective shots considering various match and point criteria.  For example, in pickleball, based on the skill level of a given opponent, when is the most effective time to attempt a drop shot.
   
   <p>It is expected that 4 Sport Challenge sites will have continuous (and autonomous) video capture, which means site owners can monetize the data collected by selling automated coaching services to its members.  This is not any different than what a human coach or trainer would do, but can be done with video collection and clever software at a fraction of the cost (which means the site owner has a higher profit margin). 
</ul>


<a name="AutomatedReferees">
<B>Automated referees</B>
<ul>
   <p>Since it is assumed that 4 Sport Challenge events have comprehensive video capture, it is assumed that automated referee feature will exist.  For example, in pickleball, it should be fairly easy to determine whether a ball is in or out.  And in golf, it should be easy to tell whether a golfer inappropriately moved their golf ball.  In table tennis, automated referee should be able to detect a service violation, or when the ball is inappropriately touched by a player (e.g., perhaps the ball contacts a player's clothing before it is successfully returned).
   
   <p>When considering indoor golf, it is expected that the automated referee will instruct players as to where they should place their golf ball after a simulated drive or approach shot (e.g., exact spot would be signaled via red dot laser beam or something equivalent).
   
   <p>Automated referees should be more cost effective, should speed up play, and offer a higher degree of reliability and consistency.
</ul>


<a name="DuelingRobots">
<B>Dueling robots</B>
<ul>
  <p>The section above on ball machines is an example of how robotics can serve as a training aide.  But there is an even more interesting aspect of robotics when considering how this could be incorporated into the basketball obstacle course.  As part of the NBA skills challenge (which is part of All-Star weekend), there is a timed obstacle course where one of the skills involves passing a basketball to a fixed target.  But a more comprehensive assessment of a player's skill would involve passing a ball to a moving target, like when making a long pass to a player sprinting down the wing on a fast break.  Imagine a robot player sprinting toward the opposing basket where the human competitor has to rebound the ball, dribble around robot defenders, and pass the ball to his robot teammate to complete the fast break.

  <p>A sufficiently advanced robot defender would be able to anticipate the trajectory of a pass and move in such a way to intercept the ball, and would also have the ability to move their arms to deflect the pass.  Likewise, the robot offensive player would have the ability to adjust to the path of the ball and attempt to redirect the caught ball toward the goal.  The offensive robot could calculate the likelihood that the pass was caught (as opposed to going out of bounds), as well as the likelihood of a made basket.

  <p>This section is titled dueling robots not only because robots are used for both offense and defense, but also because multiple vendors might be showcasing their robots in the competition.  Although this might be considered science fiction to some, robots which have sufficiently powerful cameras and advanced computer programming should be able to handle the various complexities of player movement, dribbling, passing and ball trajectory (most of this is just math - albeit more complicated math than I can comprehend).  But autonomous driving cars already exist and are currently being tested in the real world, so robot basketball players seem like a modestly small subset of what is already going on right now.   Let's just hope those robots don't learn how to commit fouls - because that might hurt.  
</ul>

<div id="RealityTvAndBroadcasting" class="main-container city" style="display:none">
<p><B>Reality shows</B>

<ul>
<p>Although it is ultimately expected that 4 Sport Challenge will evolve into a professional sports league (and thus have its own broadcasts), even before this happens, there are numerous opportunities for reality TV shows.  Here are a few examples.

<ul>
  <li><a href="#Sites">Site construction, technology and design competitions</a>
  <li><a href="#FindingTheUltimate4SportAthlete">Finding the ultimate 4 sport athlete</a>
  <li><a href="#GameShowCompetitions">Game shows</a>
  <li><a href="#CelebrityChallenge">Celebrity challenge</a>  
</ul>
</ul>


<a name="Sites">
<B>Site construction, technology and design competitions</B>
<ul>
   <p>The premise behind this reality show is 4 Sport Challenge site construction and technology. It is expected that 4 Sport Challenge sites will be both innovative and culturally interesting, so as sites come online, there would likely be some amount of interest in seeing how they are built, as well as seeing how technology is integrated into the site.  Examples of shows which already focus on things like this are: Modern Marvels, Extreme Engineering, and Dirty Jobs.
   
   <p>Although new construction for 4 Sport Challenge sites is expected, there might be opportunities to re-purpose existing sites, so another aspect of this reality show could be to tour decaying structures throughout the country and present designs to re-imagine them.
   
   <p>The TV network most aligned with this would be Discovery Channel (including HGTV, Science Channel, etc.). 

   <p><img src="RealityTVShowsSiteConstruction.jpg" alt="Examples of existing reality shows focusing on construction">
   
   <p>And since Americans seems to like shows which have some sort of competitive aspect, design competitions can be incorporated into the construction and design of 4 Sport Challenge sites.  In fact, designs could be submitted from anyone throughout the country, with reality show experts selecting the best designs to be presented on the show.  It is expected that show experts and fans voting would determine the top designs.  Then, design teams which are ultimately selected can do the build out, and industry and show experts can judge the final result.  
   
   <p>Examples of shows which already focus on this are: Brother vs Brother and Rock The Block.
   
   <p><img src="RealityTVShowsDesignCompetitions.jpg" alt="Examples of existing reality shows focusing on design competition.">
</ul>


<a name="FindingTheUltimate4SportAthlete">
<B>Finding the ultimate 4 sport athlete</B>
<ul>
   <p>The premise behind this reality show is to find the best 4 sport athletes.
   
   <p>The most obvious strategy to accomplish this would be to host 4 Sport Challenge events throughout the country and identify a subset of athletes that have the highest degree of skill across all 4 disciplines.
   
   <p>Film crews could collect footage of local events and then submit edited content to be included on the reality show.  Highly skilled competitors in local 4 Sport Challenge events could be funneled into regional events, thus narrowing in on those that are truly elite in all 4 disciplines.  Elite 4 sport athletes could be invited to compete in a year end tournament, which would also be filmed and included in the reality show.
   
   <p>An added benefit of using local (perhaps even amateur) film crews for local and regional 4 Sport Challenge events is that it offers an opportunity for those starting out in the broadcast industry to gain experience and exposure.  And as 4 Sport Challenge becomes more mature, there will be jobs available for those skilled in broadcasting.  Those submitting high quality content from local events would be auditioning for later job opportunities.  In fact, best amateur video content could even be worked into a competitive aspect of the reality show itself.
   
   <p>Additionally, a small film crew could travel the country making stops at various colleges to seek out those that are interested in 4 Sport Challenge.  It isn't known which college sports would have the best 4 sport athletes, and it isn't even known what level of interest college administrators would have in this relatively new enterprise. As for college athletes, it is possible that those that are on golf teams might have an advantage, because golf probably takes the longest amount of time to master.  But those on college basketball, tennis, pickleball, and table tennis teams might have something to say about this, so they all can be interviewed, and interesting discussions can be aired on the reality show.
   
   <p>Aside from visiting colleges, traveling film crew could seek out any and all other venues where potential 4 sport athletes might be lurking.  These include:
   <ul>
      <li>Professional sports teams
	  <li>Training centers and clubs which focus on golf, pickleball, and table tennis
	  <li>Health clubs
   </ul>
   
   <p>These additional venues might actually want to partner in local 4 Sport Challenge events (for either profit, or for charitable reasons).

   <p>The television network most aligned seems to be <a href="https://www.golfchannel.com/">The Golf Channel</a>.
</ul>



<a name="GameShowCompetitions">
<B>Game show competitions</B>
<ul>
   <p>The premise behind game show is amateurs competing against 4 Sport Athletes for prize money.
   
   <ul>
      <p>Candidate contestants would register at an authorized training center.  Registration process would include a self-assessment, after which competitors would be asked to play against a robot (see training aides section under Technology and Innovation for more information).  Data collected using a robot practice partner would be highly efficient and would make video collection and submission fair, easy and consistent.
   	  
	  <p>On the show, a contestant would get an opportunity to compete against one of many different opponents.  The opponent could be another contestant, or a 4 sport athlete that is made available by the show (such an athlete could be a celebrity, a professional, or someone that coaches 4 sports athletes).  
	  
	  <p>The contestant would have the opportunity to select the skill level of their opponent.  Alternatively, opponents' skill level could be determined by contestant's ability to answer trivia questions.  The contestant could be rewarded for correct answers by increasing the prize money awarded, or by decreasing the skill level of the opponent they have to beat (thus increasing their odds of winning).

      <p>Aside from prize money, awards could be things like 4 Sport Challenge apparel, free tickets to a 4 Sport Challenge team event, team VIP perks, or season tickets for their favorite team.  Obviously, team awards imply that professional teams and sites have come into existence.	  
   </ul>
   
   <p>The good thing about 4 Sport Challenge is that all sports can be played indoors (even golf).  This will make the show's competitive aspect very consistent, and it won't be impacted by external factors like weather.  To ensure consistency of show duration, some limitations will need to be placed on the individual competitive events.
   
   <ul>
      <p>Pickleball and table tennis can be a single game - race to 8 (no win by 2).  And for pickleball, it is expected that points would be awarded on each rally (not just when serving).
	  
	  <p>Golf could be up to 3 holes (ties would be allowed).
	  
	  <p>Basketball events are modestly short, so they perhaps don't have to be trimmed down at all.  But if desired, 3-point shooting could reduce the number of shot attempts, and for free throws, the time could be reduced.  Another option would be to have contestant and opponent perform 3-point shooting and free throws in parallel (split screen).  The benefit of parallel competition is that sound effects (e.g., crowd noise) could be used to signal a successful basket, thus increasing tension level for the participants (and perhaps enhancing excitement for viewers). 
	  
	  <p>Basketball obstacle course would serve as the tie breaker if 3-point shooting and free throws are split by the participants.  If obstacle course competition is needed to break a tie, it is expected that would not be run in parallel.	  
   </ul>
   
</ul>


<a name="CelebrityChallenge">
<B>Celebrity challenge</B>
<ul>
   <p>Although 4 Sport Challenge isn't intended to be a competition between two individuals, invariably a celebrity or athlete is going to call out some other celebrity or athlete, and challenge them to a match. The problem is that 4 Sport Challenge isn't intended to reward 1 or 2 sport athletes, and if the participants aren't well skilled in all 4 disciplines, it could result in a 2-2 split, and that wouldn't really resolve which participant was truly the best 4 sport athlete.  When each competitor wins 2 of the 4 disciplines, the following can be used to break the tie:
   
   <ol>
     <li>Add total games won in pickleball and table tennis to the number of basketball sub-activites won.   Competitor with the higher number is the winner.
	 <li>Otherwise, if a competitor won golf match by more than 9 strokes, then that competitor is the winner.
	 <li>Otherwise, a playoff will decide the winner.  The playoff will be in one of the 4 disciplines (selected at random).  For golf, sudden death playoff described under Competitive Events will be used.  For pickleball and table tennis, a single game to 11 will decide the winner.  For basketball skills, one of the 3 sub-activities will be selected at random - winner of the sub-activity will be declared the winner.
	 <li>An alternative to random selection would be for the two competitors to mutually agree on a specific discipline.  This might occur if the two competitors were evenly matched in one of the disciplines.
   </ol>
   
   <p>If celebrity challenges were to take place, follow-up progress could be reported and rematches could be scheduled.  It is possible that exposing progress made by celebrities, including training regiment, might be interesting to viewers, and could inspire them to improve their skills.

    <p>Within each discipline, the final results will rank the competitors from 1 thru N, where a competitor accumulates points for their relative position (e.g., winner of a discipline with 20 competitors will get a base score of 20 points, and will earn bonus points for coming in first, second place would earn 19 points and slightly less bonus points, etc.).

    <p>The total points accumulated across all 4 disciplines will decide the final standings.

    <p>Since the goal of 4 Sport Challenge is to recognize skill across all disciplines, additional bonus points will be awarded for competitors which win (or perform well) across multiple disciplines.   And the bonus points increase for competitors that perform well in all disciplines.  But bonus points will be subtracted for competitors which come in last (or in the bottom quartile) in a given discipline.

    <p>Each 4 Sport Challenge will start with a foot race of either 1 mile, 2 miles, or 5K.  The goal of the foot race is to demonstrate minimum fitness requirements (after all, pickleball and basketball skills require some amount of running).  But the time requirements will be relatively easy to meet (e.g., for open division, minimum mile time will likely be 9 minutes, and for other divisions, it will likely be 10 minutes).

    <p>For table tennis and pickleball, there will be a 2 round qualifying tournament which decides playoff seeding.  For modestly small events (e.g., 8-12 players), playoff would likely be 2 rounds consisting of semifinals and finals.  For larger events, a quarter final round can be introduced.  It is expected that qualifying round would seed players based on predetermined skill level so that top players don't eliminate each other. It is also expected that matches will be scheduled so that all players have roughly the same "strength of schedule".  To minimize tie break scenario for playoff consideration, total games won, and points won, will be factored into the scoring model.

    <p>Basketball skills:
    <ul>
        <li>Free throws made in 2 minutes (player must self-rebound and dribble beyond foul line).
		
        <li>3-point shooting contest - 90 seconds, 5 racks each containing 5 balls, international 3-point line is used, no gimmick shots exist (i.e., no "money ball" which has higher value).
		
        <li>Obstacle course (timed). 
		
        <li>Depending upon size of event, either top 4 or top 8 will advance to playoff round.  Playoff will be one more round with final ranking resulting from the performance of the playoff round only (performance in qualifying round won't carry over).  The overall ranking of competitors in basketball skills will consider the rankings in all 3 sub-activities where cumulative score will determine the final ranking.  For free throw and 3-point shooting, ties are allowed - competitors which have the exact same number of made baskets will merely share that relative position and will thus get awarded the same number of points.  If cumulative ranking across all 3 sub-activities results in a tie, timed result (to the millisecond) in obstacle course will break the tie. 
    </ul>
	
	<p>Golf
    <ul>
	    <li>Stoke play results will determine the overall ranking.  Extra holes may be played to determine a winner.   Aside from winner, ties are allowed - players with the very same score will be awarded the same number of points for their relative position.
    </ul>
</ul>









<a name="TeamEvents">
<B>Team events</B>
<ul>
    <p>4 Sport Challenge team events involve 2 separate teams which compete against each other.

    <p>A team consists of between 4 and 8 players (8 is ideal - at least for coed team events).  For the sake of this discussion, will focus on coed team event consisting of 4 men and 4 women.
	
	<p>For pickleball, Ping-Pong, and golf, there will be 5 matches:
    <ul>
        <li>Male singles
        <li>Female singles
        <li>Male doubles
        <li>Female doubles
        <li>Mixed doubles
    </ul>
	
    <p>For golf, match play rules will apply, and for doubles, alternate shot format will be used.  Extra holes may be played to break a tie, but to expedite event completion, a match can be decided by a chip shot closest to the pin.  Exact details for tie break are left to the discretion of the governing body hosting the event.

    <p>For basketball skills, player results will be ranked from 1 to N in each of the 3 separate skills, and then aggregate ranking score per team will decide the winner (lowest score wins each sub-category).  The 3 separate skills will be ranked individually - lowest aggregate score in 2 or more skills wins the basketball competition.  In the event of a tie, aggregate time for obstacle course will decide the winner.  
        
	<p>It is assumed that matches for all 4 sports will be completed.  The winner of a team event shall win at least 3 out of the 4 sports. If  each team wins 2 sports, the following tie break rules will decide the event winner:
    
    <ol>
       <li>Total matches won in pickleball, Ping-Pong and golf, plus number of basketball sub-categories won decides the winner.
       <li>Total number of games won in pickleball and Ping-Pong decides the winner.
       <li>Total holes won in golf decides the winner.
       <li>Aggregate time in basketball obstacle course decides the winner.
    </ol>
    
    <p>Events may be open, coed, or female only.  Males obviously may not compete in female only events, nor can a male compete in a coed match other than in the slot designated for a male.
    
    <p>Match rosters to be submitted by team captains at the start of the event (rosters are submitted in a sealed envelope).  Team captains can negotiate changes to match rosters, but absent mutual agreement, original blind submission should be followed.
</ul>


<a name="General">
<B>General</B>
<ul>
    <p>If 4 Sport Challenge event is to be completed in a single day, steps need to be taken to protect the health and well-being of the competitors.   For example, foot race might have to be completed at an earlier point in time. Additionally, table tennis and pickleball matches likely will need to be best of 3 (and not best of 5). And rounds of golf might have to be limited to 9 holes (instead of 18).

    <p>When attempting to complete an event in the shortest amount of time, it is assumed that concurrent play will be used to accomplish this.   And for table tennis and pickleball, if playoffs rounds are being held, it is assumed that players will be given adequate rest between playoff matches to keep competition as fair as possible.   One way to ensure fairness is to have all playoff matches in each round played at the same time, this way, no advancing player would have significantly more time to rest than others.   But some reasonable amount of recovery time should still be allowed, because not all matches will complete at the same time (even if they start at the same time).

    <p>Depending upon site configuration, it might be appropriate to have multiple disciplines being competed at the same time.   But as mentioned above, players health and safety must be taken into consideration, as well as overall fairness.   Therefore, breaks and recovery time for athletes must be considered.

    <p>It is assumed that all events will be captured on video, and when possible, matches should have a referee.  It is expected that technology would be available to resolve disputes (e.g., video replay), and better yet, cameras and software should be able to make calls automatically during live action.  It is expected that this technology will evolve over time, so 4 Sport Challenge events will need to continually adapt as technology improves.

<a name="Inclusiveness">
<B>Inclusiveness</B>
<ul>
    <p>First and foremost, Four Sport Challenge was invented with the premise that it would be highly inclusive.  Fairness and justice are talked about quite a bit in the media, but for Four Sport Challenge, it isn't a slogan or punchline, it is a fundamental core principle.  The 4 sports selected place a premium on skill and don't rely heavily on height, strength, speed or endurance.  So although elite athletes may do well in Four Sport Challenge, there will be plenty of room for those that are merely highly skilled.  And although women certainly can be elite athletes, at least with Four Sport Challenge, it won't be a requirement, and as such, a greater percentage of women should be able to compete at the highest level.
    
    <p>One of the more exciting aspects is the coed team event (4 man / 4 women).  This eliminates the distinction between male and female athletics, and instead places the focus on cooperation, collaboration and teamwork.  This should also broaden the base of support regarding  viewership.
    
    <p>Because there are 4 separate sports, training and dedication must be spread out across all four disciplines, so being the best of the best in any one sport is no longer a requirement.  Each year, amateurs qualify for golf's major events - so it is expected that amateurs will qualify for top tier Four Sport Challenge events.   As for professional athletes, it is hard to predict where the top Four Sport athletes will come from (might not even be from the ranks of professional sports). 
    
    <p>Due to better diet and training, professional athletes are extending their careers longer than ever before.  And because skill is more important in Four Sport Challenge, the average age of a top 4 sport athlete will likely be a bit higher than that of a typical professional athlete, and those advancing in age perhaps won't be pushed aside quite so easily.  

    <p>Three of the four sports are accessible to most - with golf being a bit more restrictive.   Unfortunately, golf is constrained by climate, availability of land, and in some respects, financial resources.   However, as golf simulators become more readily available, accessibility to golf will continue to rise.   And as technology improves, access to training through robotics, as well as coaching through video capture and sophisticated software, should allow everyone to get the practice and mentoring needed to be an outstanding 4 sport athlete.
    
    <p>And most of all, Four Sport Challenge isn't intended to only be a professional event - it is expected that Four Sport Challenge events will exist at the following levels:

    <ul>
       <li>High school
       <li>College
       <li>Recreational (i.e., local leagues based on skill level)
       <li>Virtual leagues (via robotics and golf simulators)
       <li>Amateur
       <li>Olympic / International
       <li>Professional
    </ul>
    
    <p>And although this perhaps goes without saying, elite four sport athletes aren't limited to those that are in basketball, golf, pickleball or Ping-Pong.  It is expected that competitors from football, baseball, hockey, among others, will compete quite favorably.   This is the exciting thing about Four Sport Challenge - you never know where the top four sport athletes will come from (could even come from the coaching, management or technology sector).

<a name="Popularity">

    <p>Basketball is basically everywhere in the U.S. (in all the schools, local parks, local gyms, and even in people's back yards) and has a huge media and professional footprint.  Golf, like basketball, is supported in many high schools, colleges and obviously, professionally.  Plus, most cities have numerous golf courses.  Pickleball is the <a href="https://usapickleball.org/news/fastest-growing-sport/">fastest growing</a> sport in the U.S.  And Ping-Pong is a game that many grew up playing, and most cities have Table Tennis clubs.   Plus, it is easy to put a table in your garage or basement.  Ping-Pong is not supported at the collegiate level quite the same as other sports, but there are still plenty of colleges that have Ping-Pong teams.
    
    <p>The bottom line is that the 4 sports selected are already very popular in the U.S., and many people play all of them.  Two out of the four sports have extensive media exposure (basketball and golf), and pickleball is getting more and more media coverage as its popularity grows.  It is only Ping-Pong which is lagging - but since it is a fun sport to play, it is expected that media attention surrounding Ping-Pong will increase as Four Sport Challenge gets more exposure.  And as robotics and simulators get more advanced, it will be easier for people to train in these sports - thus increasing the enjoyment and popularity even more.
</ul>


<a name="GreenField">
<B>Green field</B>
<ul>
    <p>Because Four Sport Challenge is a green field (doesn't have legacy league or venues), anyone can enter the space.  If there is an opportunity for a new professional league, and if there are opportunities to create new media or business centers, there will be business opportunities available to those not already entrenched in professional sports and entertainment.  Yes, those already in the sports and entertainment industry will try to carve out a niche for themselves, but they likely won't be able to keep it all for themselves.  A reason for this is legacy ownership groups don't like to invest in new venues because they are fearful that it will erode revenue and attention from their legacy lines of business.  Typically, legacy businesses will keep an eye on new startups, and when possible, will try to either own them entirely, or crush them completely.   But if green fields ultimately take root, it is typically with mostly new ownership groups.
    
    <p>As for professional athletes, they have voiced concerns about not having a stake in ownership, so if Four Sport Challenge were to take off, it is almost certain that some professional athletes would want a stake in ownership (regardless of whether they want to participate as competitors or not).  Incidentally, professional athletes are already starting to invest in professional pickleball (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/sport/tom-brady-pickleball-intl-spt/index.html">Tom Brady</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/sport/lebron-james-pickleball-ownership-spt-intl/index.html">Lebron James</a>, among others, are recent investors</a>).
    
    <p>The same can be said about women in professional sports - the good news for women is that Four Sport Challenge as a green field offers opportunities in all aspects - as competitors, coaches, general managers, owners and in media/broadcasting.  And remember, since professional coed teams are expected, there is no reason why half the coaches, general managers, and owners couldn't be women.
    
    <p>And if Four Sport Challenge does take off, there will be jobs at all levels for working class people (e.g., construction, broadcasting, event management, fitness, hospitality, sales and marketing, security, technology services, etc.).
</ul>


<a name="FitnessAndTrainingCenters">
<B>Fitness and Training Centers</B>
<ul>
    <p>Although sites which host Four Sport Challenge events will evolve over time, it is expected that many sites will arise which offer training for golf, basketball, pickleball and Ping-Pong.   There are already numerous sites throughout the U.S. which offer two or more of the sports (as well as overall fitness training).  It is believed that these sites will compete for the business of training four sport athletes.  Additionally, it is believed that these sites will partner with traditional golf courses so that they can host Four Sport Challenge events.
    
    <p>Over time, the notion of true indoor golf will become a reality.  At present, the simulator market is focusing on pure simulation (i.e., they are not focusing on indoor facilities which have one or more full size chipping and putting greens).  But once simulator technology is merged with sites that manage indoor chipping and putting greens, they will be able to offer a very realistic indoor golf experience.  Users will be able to play virtual golf on the most popular golf courses throughout the world and will be able to complete each hole on the site's indoor chipping and putting greens.  The software to merge approach shots to virtual hole with local site's indoor chipping and putting greens is not far off - and once offered, the indoor golf market will explode.  Companies like TopGolf and Drive Shack already support a partial golf experience - they just don't currently support indoor chipping/putting greens.  But as soon as one company offers this, the rest will follow (or will be left behind).
    
    <p>And once training centers exist which can host all sports within Four Sport Challenge, the next step will be sites which allow spectator viewing (stadium seating, restaurants, hospitality, promenades, etc.).  The evolution of Four Sport Challenge sites will take time - just as creation of coed teams will take time.  But the sites will follow the demand of both paying customers and spectators, and the athletes will follow the money.
</ul>


<a name="Broadcasting">
<B>Broadcasting</B>
<ul>
    <p>Pickleball and Ping-Pong tournaments were commonly available on YouTube but were not available on traditional broadcast networks.  But as the popularity of pickleball grows, broadcast networks are starting to carry pickleball events.  One of the more enjoyable matches recently included PGA golfer's <a href="https://golf.com/news/jordan-spieth-scottie-scheffler-pickleball/">Jordan Spieth and Scottie Scheffler</a>.  This match showed how quickly professional athletes have gravitated to pickleball (note that match also included basketball legend Dirk Nowitzki and tennis player John Isner).
    
    <p>At present, ESPN and Golf Channel seem to be the best positioned to carry Four Sport Challenge events (should they be interested in doing so).  But if they pass, there certainly are other networks waiting in line (e.g., CBS is starting to carry celebrity pickleball, and they already have a strong presence in golf).  The other wild card is how quickly international interest develops.  Ping-Pong is already very strong in Europe, Japan and China (as is golf), and basketball is already strong in Europe, and is emerging in China and Japan.   So strong international interest in Four Sport Challenge could potentially impact the U.S. broadcast market, which might impact the broadcast networks that take the lead.
    
    <p>It will be interesting to see whether pickleball as a standalone sport will carry enough broadcast interest.  The celebrity matches are  entertaining, but it is uncertain whether pickleball tournaments by themselves will hold mass viewer appeal.  The attraction of Four Sport Challenge is that it builds upon the popularity of existing sports (golf and basketball), adds the up-and-coming sport of pickleball, and completes the skill set with Ping-Pong.
    
    <p>Of course, the major sports leagues in the U.S. will continue to dominate the landscape, but there perhaps is room for a new startup.  It is possible that some combination of sports will be necessary to gain traction - and Four Sport Challenge seems to fit that niche quite well.  But golf is going through a transition period (e.g., <a href="https://www.livgolf.com/">LIV tour</a>), and there is so much competition for the leftovers after the major sports leagues have taken their market share.  Four Sport Challenge has a fighting chance because of its potential for events to be played completely indoors.  This allows spectators to enjoy all the matches from the comfort of their air-conditioned seats, all while enjoying their favorite snack foods and beverages.  
    
    <p>Local fan loyalty for their home team, in their home site, allows local merchants and service providers to form a solid relationship with the fan base (this is talked about more in the "Site Management" tab).  This should allow for a more entertaining and engaging experience for spectators, and perhaps a more profitable engagement for home team and local merchants.
</ul>



<a name="ServiceProviders">
<B>Service Providers</B>
<ul>
    <p>There are all sorts of service providers, merchants, and business partners that will be associated with Four Sport Challenge.   The following are just a few to consider:
    
    <ul>
       <li>Golf simulator companies (both hardware and software).
       <li>Those that supply and install synthetic chipping and putting greens.
       <li>Traditional golf courses.
       <li>PGA / LPGA teaching professionals.
       <li>Golf and racket equipment providers.
       <li>Sports apparel providers.
       <li>Food and hospitality providers.
       <li>Site management providers.
       <li>AI and other software services (e.g., facial recognition, automated referee, automated coaching, virtual match engagement, etc.).
    </ul>
    
    <p>The attractiveness of indoor (perhaps all day) events, and perhaps even multi day events, is that it affords merchants an opportunity to form a long term relationship with the spectators.  The reason why pickleball is the fastest growing sport in the U.S. is because people like to play it.  And when people like to play a sport, they are more inclined to watch it.  And they are more likely to buy apparel and equipment associated with those sports.  And because Four Sport Challenge is 4 different sports, it casts a modestly wide net of spectator interest, and thus allows merchants with slightly different agendas to all come together and serve the spectator community.
    
    <p>And companies that parley the indoor site experience with secondary services which extend beyond the given Four Sport Challenge event will be able to maximize revenue by having secondary relationships with the spectators. For example, training centers which support virtual matches can host consumer Four Sport Challenge events that take many days, weeks, or months to complete.  With golf simulators, and with robotic pickleball and Ping-Pong ball machines, every day consumers can compete with others of similar skill set anywhere in the world.   Golf simulator companies are already doing this very thing for golf, so this really is nothing more than an extension of the very same idea, but with four sports instead of just one.  The problem with the pure golf simulator model is that the golf simulators are rather expensive for home use, and absent real chipping and putting greens, it isn't a true/full golf experience anyway.  So companies like Top Golf and Drive Shack have an opportunity to jump into this space, but unless they embrace full (real) chipping and putting greens, they probably won't get as much traction (and once others start supplying indoor chipping and putting greens, they will have to catch up or be left behind).
