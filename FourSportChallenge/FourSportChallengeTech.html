<B>Technology</B>

<ul>
<p>As we all know, technology infiltrates virtually all aspects of our lives, so it makes sense that this would also apply to 4 Sport Challenge.  The following are just a few areas where technology could be used to enhance the 4 Sport Challenge experience.

<a name="TrainingAides">
<B>Training aides</B>
<ul>
  <p>Pickleball and ping pong ball machines have been on the market for a while (see the following reviews: 
  <a href="https://atabletennisracket.com/ping-pong-ball-machine/">ping pong</a> and 
  <a href="https://pickleballmate.com/best-pickleball-machines/">pickleball</a>).  Although the various machines are effective at what they do, there are ways to make them even better.
  
  <p>To achieve a truly effective robot practice partner, the robot must be able to interpret where the human opponent hits the ball, so the robot can deliver a return from that specific point on the court.   For example, if a human pickleball player hits the ball to the deep left portion of the court, that is where the robot should return the ball from.  The benefit is it gives the human player a more realistic experience not only with respect to return starting point, but also the timing of the robot return.  For example, a hard driven ball reaches the robot's hitting area much faster than say a lob.   This gives the human player a varied amount of time to reposition themselves on the court.  Absent such ability, the robot would have no alternative than to deliver a ball at a fixed rate every few seconds.  And a truly sophisticated robot brain would know the robot's current position on the court (when human opponent hits the ball), and thus can estimate the relative position the robot would be in when getting to the hitting area (this would determine whether the robot can make an aggressive/forceful return, or whether the robot should merely lob the ball back over the net).  And for the most realistic robot match play, the robot could even sense when the human player's return was a point winner (i.e., robot wouldn't have been able to return the ball at all).

  <p>To simulate robotic motion, either the robot ball machine needs to actually move, or, multiple ball machines throughout the field of play would be necessary (or some combination of both).  To determine landing area of human opponent's return, it is assumed that cameras will exist which can identify the speed, spin and trajectory of a return.

  <p>With these tech advancements, robot match characteristics can be categorized into skill levels, and training programs can be developed which help advance the human player's skill level.   For example, if the robot detects that the human player has trouble with deep backhand shots, such shots could be included with more frequency in a match.    
  
  <p>Another example of technology used as a training aide are golf simulators.  These allow for visualization of golf ball flight path, as well as offering swing attributes like club head speed, ball speed, ball launch angle, ball spin, maximum shot height, and ball flight curve.  There is also software which can analyze your golf swing and make recommendations (and obviously, can monitor progress and reinforce progress or call attention when golf swing regresses).
  
  <p>And with all robotic and computer aided technology, there are tons of analytics which go hand in hand (e.g., national database of player rankings, virtual matches, player progress reporting - which could drive improvements to robot's player development algorithms, etc.).  The world is already moving in this direction, 4 Sport Challenge merely would benefit from something that is already happening.  
</ul>


<a name="AutonomousVideoCapture">
<B>Autonomous video capture</B>
<ul>
   <p>It is assumed that 4 Sport Challenge sites will have comprehensive video collection so that event matches, behind the scenes activity, and training sessions are all available for distribution.  To do this cost effectively, it is assumed that the majority of the cameras (if not all) will be unmanned. But, this doesn't imply that unmanned cameras are stationary.  It is expected that intelligent software will drive the unmanned cameras so that there is some amount of camera mobility, as well as automatic adjustment of camera angle and zoom when factoring in subject matter motion (e.g., automatic ball tracking for golf shots, or automatic tracking of a basketball player as they traverse the obstacle course).
</ul>


<a name="PerformanceAnalysis">
<B>Performance analysis</B>
<ul>
   <p>Analytics is already being incorporated into legacy professional sports.  Some of this exists to help professional teams assess players, but can also be used to improve player performance.  For example, analysis of video can be used to determine whether a player's jump shot has undergone a change.  Things like launch height, launch angle and ball rotation can be measured and compared factoring in final result (made or missed basket).  
   
   <p>Video/computer analysis can be used to measure and refine a person's golf swing.
   
   <p>For table tennis and pickleball, in game strategy can be analyzed to help players determine which are the most effective shots considering various match and point criteria.  For example, in pickleball, based on the skill level of a given opponent, when is the most effective time to attempt a drop shot.
   
   <p>It is expected that 4 Sport Challenge sites will have continuous (and autonomous) video capture, which means site owners can monetize the data collected by selling automated coaching services to its members.  This is not any different than what a human coach or trainer would do, but can be done with video collection and clever software at a fraction of the cost (which means the site owner has a higher profit margin). 
</ul>


<a name="AutomatedReferees">
<B>Automated referees</B>
<ul>
   <p>Since it is assumed that 4 Sport Challenge events have comprehensive video capture, it is assumed that automated referee feature will exist.  For example, in pickleball, it should be fairly easy to determine whether a ball is in or out.  And in golf, it should be easy to tell whether a golfer inappropriately moved their golf ball.  In table tennis, automated referee should be able to detect a service violation, or when the ball is inappropriately touched by a player (e.g., perhaps the ball contacts a player's clothing before it is successfully returned).
   
   <p>When considering indoor golf, it is expected that the automated referee will instruct players as to where they should place their golf ball after a simulated drive or approach shot (e.g., exact spot would be signaled via red dot laser beam or something equivalent).
   
   <p>Automated referees should be more cost effective, should speed up play, and offer a higher degree of reliability and consistency.
</ul>


<a name="DuelingRobots">
<B>Dueling robots</B>
<ul>
  <p>The section above on ball machines is an example of how robotics can serve as a training aide.  But there is an even more interesting aspect of robotics when considering how this could be incorporated into the basketball obstacle course.  As part of the NBA skills challenge (which is part of All-Star weekend), there is a timed obstacle course where one of the skills involves passing a basketball to a fixed target.  But a more comprehensive assessment of a player's skill would involve passing a ball to a moving target, like when making a long pass to a player sprinting down the wing on a fast break.  Imagine a robot player sprinting toward the opposing basket where the human competitor has to rebound the ball, dribble around robot defenders, and pass the ball to his robot teammate to complete the fast break.

  <p>A sufficiently advanced robot defender would be able to anticipate the trajectory of a pass and move in such a way to intercept the ball, and would also have the ability to move their arms to deflect the pass.  Likewise, the robot offensive player would have the ability to adjust to the path of the ball and attempt to redirect the caught ball toward the goal.  The offensive robot could calculate the likelihood that the pass was caught (as opposed to going out of bounds), as well as the likelihood of a made basket.

  <p>This section is titled dueling robots not only because robots are used for both offense and defense, but also because multiple vendors might be showcasing their robots in the competition.  Although this might be considered science fiction to some, robots which have sufficiently powerful cameras and advanced computer programming should be able to handle the various complexities of player movement, dribbling, passing and ball trajectory (most of this is just math - albeit more complicated math than I can comprehend).  But autonomous driving cars already exist and are currently being tested in the real world, so robot basketball players seem like a modestly small subset of what is already going on right now.   Let's just hope those robots don't learn how to commit fouls - because that might hurt.
