<li>Sitemap of mall below demonstrates how an intelligent public safety application can help law enforcement and potentially save lives.  

<li>The premise is that continuous analysis of video feeds from onsite cameras can detect hostile actions, track hostile actors, and communicate with law enforcement and those on site.

<li>Each time appearing in sitemap below(starting with 11:30am) can be clicked to obtain additional information.  Note that arrows in sitemap merely point out exit points (they don't imply directional flow).
