<ul>
  <p>In light of the recent terrorist attacks in our country, and given that there is so much debate and bickering among those in the media about what can be done, I find myself thinking about things which might actually help.   Now some of what I express below might seem insensitive, especially since we live in a world of intolerance and hypersensitivity, but I'm suspicious that once the initial awkwardness is overcome, many of the ideas below will likely be accepted.  So please, let's start a public discussion about things which can help make us safer - certainly we can all agree that is necessary.  My premise is that improved cooperation, collaboration, and training, coupled with better technology, methods and procedures, will go a long way to improved safety for all.

  <p>This article covers the following main topics:
  <ul>
    <p><li>Improved methods and procedures
        <ul>
	       <li>How can those trapped in a crisis situation spontaneously form a cohesive team?
		   <li>Are there improved methods which law enforcement and first responders can leverage?
		   <li>How do we increase community engagement before a crisis arises?
		   <li>How do we train those in society so that they are better prepared during a crisis?
		   <li>How can we practice crisis response in a safe and effective way?
	    </ul>
	   
    <p><li>Technology
	    <ul>
	        <li>Are there improved surveillance techniques which can help?
			<li>Are there building/structural issues which can be improved?
			<li>Are there improvements in communication which can help first responders and those trapped in a crisis.
        </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
  <p>Those trapped in a crisis situation typically have the highest degree of success when they can work closely with others (including first responders).   Cooperation, collaboration, and effective communication are essential in minimizing loss of life and increase the likelihood of accomplishing an objective.  The problem is that during a crisis, it is very rare that those trapped in the crisis have time to strategize and coordinate a response.   This is especially true when the training and physical capabilities of those in the crisis vary greatly.  Sure, there are rare instances where a group of well trained people happen to be in a crisis situation, and because of their training, they can act in a coordinated fashion.  But sadly, this is not the common case.  It is much more likely that those in a crisis situation are not well trained, have varied physical skills, have little or no access to weapons, and have little or no means of communicating with others in the crisis.

  <p>In a later section, I will address improved technology, and improved methods and procedures, but this first topic will be on community engagement.   And as I mentioned above, this might be a bit sensitive for some (actually, I think we are all struggling to deal with the notion of terrorism at our doorstep), but obviously, for some, the wounds are very fresh - so I apologize in advance if anyone is offended.

  <p>Given that we live in a Television/YouTube culture, I'm going to suggest that training and collaboration be inspired via some sort of reality TV show.  Now I realize that there is a stigma that reality TV is nothing more than gratuitous fluff invented by TV executives who are hungry for ratings and lust over money.   But when you consider the horror of what happened in Orlando recently, let's not forget the round the clock news coverage.  The news media is kind of like a reality show, but I'm not sure they're doing enough to make us safer, and they're not making us better prepared for the next crisis.  So I've got this crazy notion that perhaps we need to take a bit more control, and invent strategies and policies which are designed to make us safer.  

  <a name="EngagementThroughRealityTV">
  <p>The premise for the new reality show is: "How to survive in an active crisis situation."
  
  <p>There are already survival shows which address surviving in the outdoors, including how to survive a natural disaster, so it is only a matter of time before the next wave of reality shows start addressing how to cope with acts of terrorism.   It is an extremely sensitive subject, so it has to be handled with respect and dignity.   But once the ball gets rolling, it could be viewed as a very positive thing.  Remember for a second the nonsense from the 1960s and 1970s about surviving a nuclear bomb (i.e., "get under your desk at school and cover your head").  What I'm expressing here could actually help.  But again, it has to be done with dignity and not merely as gratuitous entertainment.

  <p>Potential benefits:
  <ul>
    <li>Charitable contributions to local communities to combat violence and help victims
    <li>Community involvement
    <li>Emotional connection
    <li>Viewer training (learning what to do, and what to avoid)
    <li>Sense of empowerment (instead of helplessness)
    <li><i title="Hopefully this would include engagement with local law enforcement and first responders.">Viewer engagement</i>
    <li><i title="I feel uncomfortable mentioning this, but this tends to be an important aspect in our society, so we shouldn't overlook this - remember, community engagement is essential.">Competition</i> and <i title="I'm  hopeful that the competition aspect allows us to witness various outcomes, and thus can help us visualize what will work and what won't work.  I'm not sure a scripted model will result in the best strategies, because real world outcomes tend to be more trustworthy than strategies born out of theory alone.">assessments</i>
    <li>Technology spin-offs
    <li>Improved methods and procedures
  </ul>

  <p>Guests and supplemental story lines:
  <ul>
    <li>Back stories - with guests that have been affected by a crisis.
    <li>Law enforcement and first responders.
    <li>Would likely need multiple hosts, each of whom would be responsible for a specific segment of participation.
    <li>Additional guests would offer lectures and perform demonstrations (e.g., personal defense, combat techniques, etc.), as well as experts leading technology discussions.
  </ul>

  <p>Competitive aspects:
  <ul>
    <li>Individual events to see who responds best in various scenarios.
    <li>Perhaps divide into novice and expert categories.
    <li>Scenarios can involve things like escape, diversions and <i title="E.g., is it recommended to leave your cell phone recording when you flee - this might give police more information either in real time, or at least after the fact.">surveillance</i>.
    <li>Team events for collaborative scenarios (i.e., how to take down a lone attacker).
    <li>Technology improvements - these too should be assessed, and the best technology improvements should be endorsed.
  </ul>

  <p>Locations:
  <ul>
    <li>Studio
    <li>Simulated settings (e.g., school, nightclub, office building, hospital, shopping mall)
    <li>Both indoor and outdoor settings
    <li>Think paint-ball setting but with more real world aspects.
  </ul>

  <p>Show format:
  <ul>
    <li>Both taped events and live action.
    <li>Taped events would be for training purposes and back story.
    <li>Live portion would be for competitive aspect of show.
    <li>Voting won't necessarily eliminate contestants or teams, but is should highlight preferred strategies and reward successful individuals and teams. 
    <li>The goal is for identification of the best strategies and most effective methods and procedures - so not only is voting important, but <i title="If paint-ball was the competition, then team with the fewest 'hits' would be recognized as the most successful.">measurable performance results</i> must be factored into the equation.
  </ul>

  <p>Viewer engagement:
  <ul>
    <li>Voting at various levels (for favorite team, for favorite defensive strategy, for favorite offensive strategy, etc.).
    <li>Viewer suggestions for improved strategies, and critique of show and strategies.
    <li>Viewer participation - certain viewers could even be invited to participate.
  </ul>
  
  <p>Social media:
  <ul>
     <li>Would be used to not only solicit feedback about existing shows, but also for recommendations about improved strategies, or topics for subsequent shows.
	 <li>Would be valuable for technology discussions - this is happening every day on the web anyway, so might as well tap into this to help make us safer.  It is likely that some of the technology will be evolved by high tech companies (and likely for profit), but some technology might be available <i title="Let's not forget that there is plenty of open source software that is used in business every day, so if there are phone apps which can help, or if those in cyberspace are willing to help out, we really should engage them and leverage what ever we can.">for free</i>.

<ul>
  <ul>
    <p><li>For people trapped in a crisis site, need to evolve software to interconnect cell phones to the site's main network (and to each other), so that a coordinated strategy can be utilized.  This requires real time authentication and authorization (i.e., need security measures to keep attackers locked out of the system).
	
    <p><li>Evolve application for audio and video streaming from multiple devices to police 911 operators, and then  distribute to a secured site.  This would allow first responders to view the consolidated streams in real time.
	
    <p><li>Facilitate better two way communication between those on site (including those trapped in the crisis) and first responders.
	
    <p><li>Evolve cell phone apps to collect video and audio content immediately (e.g., 1 touch activation).   Some of this perhaps can be auto activated if in a crisis location (e.g., wifi perhaps can push a terror alert to the phone, and if the cell phone app accepts, can instantly connect two way streaming of text, video and audio).
	
    <p><li>Direct linkup to other phones in the same crisis location (i.e., offer a means for those in the site to instantly connect to each other).  Will probably need a coordinator role to avoid a flood of communication where everyone is communicating over each other (software which can analyze all of this and manage traffic would be helpful).
	
    <p><li>Evolve phone apps for silent gesture responses (e.g., hand signals, lip reading software, etc.).
	
    <p><li>Leverage phones as source of distraction with timed response to allow potential escape.
	
    <p><li>Leverage phones to convey exit/rescue strategy (e.g., floor plan of site).
        <ul>
            <p><li>For sites that have cameras which have eyes on the attacker, intelligent software can be evolved which tracks the movement of the attacker in relation to people hiding (implies phone is connected to sites main network, so site knows each phone's exact location).  With this, instructions to the individual person's phone can be customized in real time so that the person can react to instructions (e.g., "stay low and move right", or "head for the exit to your left now").
            <p><li>Intelligent software could instruct/trigger a coordinated response - this obviously would require split second timing, and would imply that there were those on site that were physically capable of attempting an offensive response.
        </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
		
		
<a name="TechnologyGaming">
<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Technology - Gaming</em>
<ul>
  <p>This too will be a little bit uncomfortable to consider, because when most think about gaming, they think about trivial games which have little or no redeeming value, or even worse, think about games that glorify violence.  But there are plenty of computer, tablet and phone based "games" which can help people learn.  As an example, there are computer programs which help correct visual convergence issues (i.e., they help train the eyes to converge - well, for those that have this visual impairment).  There are yet other computer programs which help with auditory processing deficiencies.  So if we could figure out a way to get gaming companies to engage in producing games which help people react better during a crisis, then not only could there be a potential for higher user engagement, but we might actually contribute to a better informed and more skilled community - and after all, that is the entire focus of this article.  Off the top of my head, I could imagine how the following games/apps might help:
  
  <ul>
    <p><li>Game that helps with reading site maps
        <Ul>
		    <p>My premise is that even if a map of the current site were presented on a smart phone, the average person, at least during a crisis, might not be able to read it.  Now with sufficiently smart technology and software, it might be possible to present a map which is oriented based on the user's justification in a given spot within a site.  But still, having users practice following exit instructions offered in a phone "game" might improve performance.  
		</ul>
	
    <p><li>Game that helps with non verbal communications
        <ul>
		    <p>Bi-directional communication is critical during a crisis, and given background noise and other distractions, or when hiding, non verbal communication might be necessary.  So consider games which help with non verbal communication.  And remember, texting isn't necessarily the most efficient form of non verbal communication.  So assuming hand signals or other forms of non verbal communication are established as a vernacular, the training and practice of that vernacular perhaps would be well suited for a gaming app.
		</ul>
		
	<p><li>Game that re-enforces critical thinking
	   <ul>
	       <p>Now I know what you are thinking - if such apps existed, why wouldn't they be common place right now - after all, don't we want to improve the critical thinking of everyone in our society?  And the answer to that is, "off course we do".   But my premise is that during a crisis, critical thinking, situational awareness, and rapid / fluid decision making could be the difference between life and death.  So if games could be developed which present the user with various scenarios, and then perhaps even have those scenarios change in the moment, measuring user's response time to critical thinking questions could better prepare users for crisis situations.
	   </ul>
  </ul>
  
  <p>And one last point about gaming, the major benefit to gaming is that it is yet another avenue for community engagement.   The very same reasons why a reality TV show might be the best vehicle to stimulate community involvement is the very same justification for leveraging gaming.  Without engagement, it doesn't matter how well things are documented, and it doesn't matter how many great strategies exist, if people don't know about them, and if people aren't well practiced in the strategies, then it doesn't really help at all.   Reality TV can cross promote gaming, and gaming can cross promote reality TV, and all of this can help in community engagement.  Now the key is to do all of this really well, and that won't happen all at once - it has to evolve over time.   And for the naysayers out there, the notion that this has to evolve over time might seem like a negative, but it actually is a huge positive.   This is because retail companies will be the ones that roll out the games and reality TV shows, and those companies operate on a profit motive.  It is the indefinite need for public safety, coupled with the fact that this WILL be evolving over time, that will afford retail companies the time to continually improve and innovate.

<ul>
  <p>Below are some ideas regarding buildings/structures.  I don't have a background in building codes, so I only offer this to wet the appetite.  But certainly, building experts, especially those well versed in counter terrorism, will have plenty to say on this topic.

  <ul>
  <li>Entry and exit points - are there any technology improvements which can deal with auto locking and unlocking of doors.
    <p><li>Should safe rooms with bullet proof glass be considered - and how does this relate to entry and exit strategies.
	<p><li title="Controlling such building systems can aide first responders in both defensive and offensive strategies.">Need to consider a building's infrastructure and how it should function in a crisis:
	<ul>
        <li>Electrical
        <li>Communications

        <li>Lighting

<ul>
  <p>Hopefully I've expressed enough information in this article for people to see the value of further discussion.  I have no idea whether what I'm expressing will ever go anywhere, but I wanted to at least express some high level goals:
  <ul>
    <li>A better trained and engaged community
    <li>Better methods and procedures
    <li>Better technology
    <li>Better building structures
    <li>Diminished sense of helplessness
    <li>Heightened sense of hope and empowerment.

<a name="CounterArgument">
<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Counter argument</em>
<ul>
  <p>Although I've expressed potential benefits if we have greater community engagement and better training, there still are some problem areas which should be considered when tackling such a sensitive subject as violence and terrorism.  So in this section, I'll address issues which perhaps will be raised by those with doubts and fears.
  
  <ul>
    <li>Could we be giving away secrets which will make terrorists even stronger?
	    <ul>
		   <p>Certainly the news media already faces this very issue (so it is nothing new).  There is a balancing act between informing the general public and divulging sensitive information.   So out of all the concerns in this section, this one probably isn't that big a deal.  Of course, when dealing with technology issues, there likely will be some things that won't (or shouldn't) be discussed.   But my guess is the top secret stuff that the various defense agencies are involved with will have nothing to do with what would be discussed in a reality TV show (because experts from those agencies wouldn't be appearing on a TV show).   And I don't think discussions on how cell phones can be used to broadcast video content in real time is a secret anyway.
		   
		   <p>And let's be honest for a second, terrorists are already training to be effective at their mission.  It isn't like all of a sudden they're going to decide to train harder because those that they wish to attack are evolving defensive tactics.   Warfare is always a very fluid and evolving activity, so we'll have to continually adapt, because those that wish us harm will be adapting whether we want them to or not.
		</ul>
	
	<li>Will engaging in community action, defensive training, and site hardening rob us of freedom, and will it erode the overall quality of our day to day lives?
	    <ul>
		   <p>This is actually one of my biggest fears. For me personally, I struggle with this conflict every day.   I would much prefer to bury my head in the sand and just pretend that these threats just don't exist.   My problem is that I watch the news too much, and when I see all the bad things that are happening in the world, my natural instinct is to try to solve them.  I realize that I can't solve the world's problems, but that doesn't mean I don't want to try.  My conflict is that although I sometimes want to give up, my fear is that if I give up, then maybe everyone else will give up as well.
		   
		   <p>So yes, focusing on how to minimize loss of life as a result of a terrorist attack is an expensive endeavor in regards to time, money, and emotional commitment. And yes, it would be way more enjoyable to spend that time doing "fun stuff".  But we've already suffered an erosion to our quality of life in regards to air travel, and sadly, similar incursions will likely creep into other aspects as well.   Man kind has been filled with such wasteful activity throughout its history, so this really shouldn't surprise anyone.  I think the most apparent aspect to all of this is that since we've been very fortunate for so long, we forgot the hardships of the past (during World War II for instance).  
		</ul>
	
	<li>What if a proposed strategy doesn't work perfectly all the time - how will that make us feel?
        <ul>
            <p>The short answer is we're going to feel horrible.  But what we need most is a reality check.  The sad truth is that no strategy will be 100% effective.   The best we can hope for is to minimize the risk and save as many people as we can.  I think it is important to meet this emotional component head on, because I think this has been one of the biggest challenges facing our government.   The challenge for those in government is that they get their power from the will of the people, and if the will of the people is adverse to any definitive action (because of fear of failure), then our government is robbed of the tools it needs to solve the difficult problems.   I'm not defending the actions of our government, but we should all understand that they are people too, and if they are held to an unrealistic standard that there can be zero loss of life, or there can be zero terrorist attacks, then they will never be able to meet that expectation.   And if zero negative consequences is the gate criteria for government action, then all our government will do is engage in bickering and debate, and will suffer from gross inactivity.
			
			<p>So let's all remember that no strategy will ever be perfect.  And even if it were, it would never be followed perfectly.  The world is a very complicated and fluid place, and the conditions during a crisis are rarely identical to the circumstances defined when the strategy was devised.  So well trained and talented individuals must be able to adapt to the given circumstances, and try the best they can to resolve the crisis.   In general, first responders do an amazing job, but we must be realistic in regards to what they can actually accomplish.  We all understand that medical treatment isn't 100% effective, so we just have to acknowledge that this too is the case with the war on terror.  We cannot establish unrealistic expectations as the gate criteria for action, otherwise, we will never act at all.  And we all need to be aware of the consequences of inactivity.
        </ul>

    <li>What if we try to engage the community (via a reality TV show) and such engagement is rejected?
	    <ul>
		   <p>This is perhaps my second biggest fear - i.e., what if a reality TV show is proposed but never gets off the ground?  If that turns out to be the case, then all it means is that we're not ready yet.  But this shouldn't surprise anyone.  Prior to our official entry into World War II, Great Britain was being continually bombed.   But the sentiment by many in our country was that we shouldn't get involved (i.e., it was their problem, not ours).   Then in early December, we got bombed one day and everything changed.  I'm not sure what it will take for those in this country to become fully vested in the war on terror - after all, it is already on our doorstep. Sooner or later the American people are going to take the lead on this - and once they do, the media, and our government will step up and join us.   So I'm not going to be disheartened by hesitation, because sooner or later that will give way to action.  I suggest that we start the debate, move the ball forward a little bit, keep the things that work, and revise the things that don't.  It is a pretty simple formula - all we need to do is try, the rest will work itself out in the process.
