<ul>
  <p>The following is a high level project plan for improved engagement surrounding public safety in the United States.  The motivation for this is a simple premise:  
  <ul>
    Heightened community involvement, coupled with engagement by those in law enforcement, Emergency Management departments, technology companies, and the media, when working collaboratively on the topic of public safety, can achieve the best results.   
  </ul>

  <p>For background, refer to an <u><a href="MakingAmericaSafer_Intro.html">initial publication</a></u> surrounding engagement leveraging the media (i.e., a suggestion for a new "reality TV show" focusing on public safety).  That article not only details some facets surrounding the TV show, but also includes some suggestions for improved technology and better methods and procedures.   But note, the article isn't designed to be the blue print for all improvements, it merely exists as a starting point to get the ball rolling.
</ul>


<a name="PublicSectorEngagement">
<h3 onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">1. Public sector engagement</h2>

<ul>
   It is believed that those working in the public sector, be it in law enforcement, <i>EMS</i>, or administrative services, would be the most likely to contribute to this collaborative effort.  After all, it is part of their job description.  And besides, those working in local public sector jobs typically care very deeply about their community, and thus try very hard to make a positive impact.  It is for this reason that phase 1 of engagement involves connecting individuals in each county, to those in other counties within their given state.  The goals is to nominate at least 2 public sector workers from each county.  The roles and responsibilities of such candidates can vary based on individual preference (i.e., some may want to have an active role, while others might want to be more passive).  But it certainly is important to have all (or at least most) counties within a given state connected and engaged.   
   
   <p>It is acknowledged that counties are strapped for cash, and thus don't have a lot of time or money to invest.  But this is precisely why this sort of engagement is sorely needed - because the premise is that media air time, and perhaps even some amount of support from technology companies, would be free of charge.   After all, technology companies don't charge for requirements gathering efforts - so if law enforcement has recommendations for improved technology (see <a href="MakingAmericaSafer_Intro.html#TechnologyImprovements">technology recommendations</a> for suggestions), it doesn't cost anything to ask.  There is no guarantee that technology companies will deliver, but you never know until you ask.  And there are plenty of open source projects on the internet, so if retail tech companies don't step up, there might be other alternatives.  And note, although this will be discussed later, there are plenty of free ways to offer video content over the internet, so if media companies aren't eager to engage, a well organized group with a large number of members has lots of options to choose from.  Of course, considering that media companies are merely looking for viewership, it is highly likely that they will be a very willing participant - but that probably would only happen once all the other partnerships have been established. 
   
   <ol>
     <li><p>Get <i title="This could be as simple as name, job title, email address, and role.">registered members</i> documented and engaged.
	 
	 <li><p>Establish methods and procedures for documentation, reviews and publication.
	 
	 <li><p>Establish methods and procedures for code of conduct, roles and responsibilities, security and auditing, and web administration.
	 
	 <li><p>In the short term, it is believed that each individual county will manage their own documents, and some low tech solution (perhaps even email attachments) will suffice until a more robust and official mechanism is rolled out.  Again, the key is little or no cost, so each county will likely have to do their own admin.  But this probably won't be that bad, because they probably already have some level of administrative support to handle this (after all, each county already has a public web site).
	 
	 <li><p>Long term, it would be more appropriate to take advantage of browser based publication with all the nice social features (e.g., like/dislike, change history, surveys and voting, user roles, notification preferences and user profiles).  But until a community is actually established, it doesn't make sense to even consider this (because those in the community would vote on methods and procedures).
	 
	 <li><p>Once membership is established for each county, it would be up to those team members to begin proposing ideas for safety improvements and improved community engagement, they would publish documents for review, would have peer reviews, and this would be followed by wide audience review.   Approved documents would be published and a plan of action would be taken.  All of this would be done in parallel with other items addressed below.  And note, it might seem like all the work is being "dumped" on the public sector, but this is only to the degree that they want to have an active role.  When reality TV rollout takes place, those in the public sector can serve as a "voting block" and can serve as expert reviewers (well, at least those within law enforcement and EMS that wish to serve that role).
	 
	 <li><p>It is suggested that engagement start with a single state (e.g., Florida), and as methods and procedures stabilize, additional states can be brought online.  Long term, all states should be included, but a phrased in approach is necessary because there certainly will be some growing pains.   It is highly likely that individual counties within a state don't collaborate as much as they could, and it wouldn't be completely surprising if individual counties had their own procedures for web site administration and information sharing.  
	 
	 <li><p>Note that it isn't the goal of this initiative to facilitate infrastructure to be used by all counties within a single state (or all states across the country).  Of course, that might turn out to be a byproduct of this initiative, but that will be up to those that choose to participate.   Engagement is the key aspect to making this country safer, the manner in which people and organizations choose to collaborate merely addresses the notion of efficiency and consistency.  Now when talking about the strategies which are agreed upon, or the improved technology which is rolled out, certainly consistency will be a key aspect.   But the manner in which people communicate and interact to evolve improved procedures and/or technology is of little consequence and shouldn't be a gate criteria for this initiative (or else that would cause delays and thus put public safety in jeopardy).
   </ol>
</ul>


<a name="TechnologyCompanyEngagement">
<h3 onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">2. Technology company engagement</h2>

<ul>
   <p>Shortly after public sector engagement commences, technology companies will be contacted and will be asked to participate in requirements gathering sessions.  Tech companies are actually fairly skilled at this, so this really is nothing out of the ordinary.   They will certainly realize that individual counties won't be paying for the technologies improvements that will ultimately be suggested, but none the less, they will benefit from the process of refining (and documenting) the technology improvement needs.  In fact, tech companies very often document requirements long in advance of the actual implementation.

   <p>For now, the details surrounding registration of tech companies will be omitted.  Just assume that there will be a project management page that expresses each tech company that is participating and their role on the project.  Furthermore, assume that there will be a publication of proposed requirements with a status next to each of them (e.g., proposed requirement, approved requirement, requirement under design and/or implementation, solution in test phase, etc.).
   
   <p>In the reality TV article, the notion of <u><a href="MakingAmericaSafer_Intro.html#TechnologyGaming">gaming</a></u> was mentioned as a possible way to heighten user engagement and improve user skills.   So engagement with gaming companies would need to take place at some stage.  But this likely would be after reality TV show rollout, so for now, this will not be documented (it is just too far off in the future).
</ul>


<a name="MediaCompanyEngagement">
<h3 onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">3. Media company engagement</h2>

<ul>
   <p>Shortly after public sector engagement commences, media companies will be contacted and it will be determined whether any wish to participate.  If so, then they would likely have a major say in the manor in which video content is produced and presented to viewers.   There are a ton of individual steps that would have to take place if/when this comes to fruition, so they won't be listed at this time.  It would be expected that some amount of change would take place as each additional group is added into the equation.  
   
   <p>It is likely that each new group would want to control as much as they can - in fact, power struggles for control might be common place.   For the sake of this initiative, it probably would be best for no one organization to have too much power or control.  The collective should be in control, where its power is derived from all of its members.   This is why open source web tools should be strongly favored over a tool set which is owned and operated by a single company.   And even if a tool set from a single company is used, any and all project deliverables should be owned either by the collective or the individual contributers, and portability (i.e., port out) should be a gate criteria for all decisions that are made.
   
   <p>If for some reason no traditional media company wishes to take on the challenge of a reality TV show, then an independent production company should be considered.   It is likely that an independent media company would serve as a "middle man" anyway, so that alone shouldn't be a cause for alarm.  The key here is that if sufficient engagement occurs from the public sector, then tech companies will fall in line, and if both public sector and tech companies come together and collaborate, then media companies shouldn't be that far behind.  In fact, if traditional media companies drag their feet too much, then tech companies will likely step up.  After all, Amazon, Netflix, and Google are all getting into the content distribution arena, so a well organized collective has more than adequate influence.  Remember, there are a few things which bode very well for this initiative:
   <ul>
     <li>Public safety is a huge concern (so there is plenty of demand).
	 <li>The media is already spending quite a bit of time on this topic (so they are already invested in the subject).
	 <li>Those in the public sector are already fully vested - so they get a benefit if this initiative progresses.
	 <li>Tech companies are in the business of innovation, and future revenue streams are a huge incentive for them.
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3 onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">4. Reality TV show rollout</h2>

<ul>
   <p>Everything expressed above is kind of a waste if some form of reality TV show isn't rolled out.   The entire premise behind this initiative is that a reality TV show is the most effective means of engaging the community at large.  So this last phase would involve producing and broadcasting episodes of the show, monitoring feedback, and iteratively improving the show.  As part of this, it is expected that improved methods and procedures, and improved technology, would be rolled out (so documents and other content - like instructional videos, would also be published and/or re-published).
