   <p>Public safety is one of the most important things for governments to consider.  The following is an overview of new technology and improved procedures which deal with the topic of public safety.
   
   <ul>
       <li><a title="This contains a few use cases which express how the Public Safety App can be used in the real world." href="PublicSafetyApp.UseCases.html">Public Safety App - Use Cases</a>
       
       <li><a title="This is a draft of requirements which could be incorporated into a yet to be developed software application.  Many of the technologies will seem like they are cutting edge, but the reality is that many are in existence today, and likely can be adapted to play a major role in public safety." href="PublicSafetyApp.Requirements.html">Public Safety App - Draft Requirements</a>

       <li><a title="Since government is fully vested in public safety, they almost certainly should be a major player in defining requirements and help in rollout of public safety software initiatives.  This document describes a potentially different role for government than they've had in the past." href="PublicSafetyApp.RoleOfGovernment.html">Public Safety App - Role of Government</a>
       
       <li><a title="This is an article I wrote shortly after the Pulse night club shooting in Orlando.  Its main premise is that public safety can be greatly improved if there is increased community engagement, better technology, and better methods and procedures." href="MakingAmericaSafer_Intro.html">Making America Safer</a>

<a name="UseCases">
<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Use Cases</em>

<ul>   
    <p>I wrote the article <a href="PublicSafetyApp.UseCases.html">Use Cases</a> to demonstrate a few real world scenarios where a Public Safety App can help.  Here are a few highlights from the article:
    
    <ul>
        <li>Identify previously black-listed individual via facial recognition.
        <li>Hostile action is automatically detected.
        <li>Hostile actor attempts to change appearance and slip away during mass evacuation.
        <li>Automatic accomplice detection via proximity.
        <li>Automatic accomplice detection via national database integration.
        <li>Civilians are trapped in a facility under a crisis alert - self evacuation.
        <li>Civilians are trapped in a facility under a crisis alert - assisted evacuation.
    </ul>
</ul>


<a name="DraftRequirements">
<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Draft Requirements</em>

<ul>   
    <p>I wrote the article <a href="PublicSafetyApp.Requirements.html">Draft Requirements</a> to highlight specific things (mostly from a technology perspective) which are needed to promote public safety.  Many of the technologies exist today in some form or another, but will have to be integrated into an end to end application to be truly useful.  Requirements cover things like:
    
    <ul>
        <li>Utilize facial recognition software to identify previously flagged individuals.
        <li>Utilize automated analysis of video camera feeds to detect hostile actions and track hostile actors.
        <li>Integrate feeds from onsite cameras and cell phones to command center console.
        <li>Trigger alarms and notifications based on automated threat detection.
        <li>Notifications may be sent to Smart phones for those within a site that is under a crisis alert.
        <li>Tracking of Smart phones within site map (e.g., presented in command center console).
        <li>Utilize biometrics within Smart phone to locate survivors.
        <li>Integrate building infrastructure (e.g., lights, alarms, auto locking doors) with command center console.
        <li>Automated video feed distribution to law enforcement.
        <li>Users, User groups, Roles, and Security (authentication and authorization).
    </ul>
</ul>


<a name="RoleOfGovernment">
<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Role of Government</em>

<ul>   
    <p>I wrote the article <a href="PublicSafetyApp.RoleOfGovernment.html">Role of Government</a> to explain why governments need to get involved in technology in a totally different way.  Here are a few highlights from the article:
    
    <ul>
        <li>Why ever increasing complexity in technology sector mandates a paradigm shift.
        <li>How to prevent going down a dead end.
        <li>How to rollout complex solutions in an ever changing world.
        <li>Importance of standards and how to get community buy-in.
        <li>Why IT vendors are willing to participate - but only if they are required.
    </ul>
</ul>

<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Making America Safer</em>

<ul>   
    <p>I wrote the article <a href="MakingAmericaSafer_Intro.html">Making America Safer</a> a few days after the Pulse night club shooting.  Here are a few highlights from the article:
    
    <ul>
        <li>Heightened community engagement can lead to better preparation.
        <li>Technology improvements are considered (e.g., Smart phone apps, automated analysis of video streams from surveillance cameras).
        <li>Improved methods and procedures are considered (integrating technology and facility infrastructure).
        <li>Improved communication with law enforcement and those trapped within a crisis is considered.
        <li>Reality shows and gaming apps may lead to increased community engagement.
    </ul>
