<ul>
   <p>The following is a draft set of requirements for a yet to be developed public safety application.   It is referred 
   to as a single thing, but is really a series of services which operate on various
   platforms and utilize many different technologies.   The expression of requirements serves the following:
   
   <ul>
      <li>Expose things of value which promote public safety.
      <li>Form a community focused on promoting public safety through improved technology and training.             
      <li>Get the ball rolling on iterative expression and refinement of requirements.
      <li>Ultimately rollout an agreed upon set of requirements (i.e., baseline process).
      <li>Utilize requirements to evolve a baselined spec (public interfaces).
      <li>Encourage rollout of commercial solutions which satisfy requirements and adhere to baselined specification.
   </ul>
</ul>


<a name="Assumptions">
<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Assumptions</em>

<ul>
  <li>Site will be fully covered by multiple cameras, all of which contain microphones and speakers.
  <li>Cameras will be integrated with centralized brain (i.e., Public Safety App).
  <li>Site infrastructure (e.g., buildings, lighting, doors, elevators, electrical, sound system, etc.) will be integrated with Public Safety App.
  <li>Security staff will exist to configure and monitor Public Safety App.
  <li>Local and state regulators, first responders, and IT experts will be intimately involved.
  <li>Baselined requirements and specifications allow (and mandate) a single view of behavior across diverse sites and locations
      (i.e., everything from Public Safety App perspective should work exactly the same regardless of particular site or service provider operating security for the site).
  <li>Because solutions will be implemented using baselined specifications, interoperability across sites and locations will be seamless (facilitates real time sharing of data when appropriate).
</ul>


<a name="NotificationTriggers">
<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, sectionMenu, '260px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Notification Triggers</em>

<ul>
  <li>Public Safety App allows for configuration of trigger rules, some examples are:
      <ul>
         <li>Key word phrases (e.g., gun, shooter, "get down")
         <li>Certain sounds (gun shot, mass screaming)
         <li>Black listed individuals
         <li>Hostile actions (e.g., person exposing a fire arm or other weapon, physical assault)
         <li>Mass panic (e.g., rapid dispersion of people from a specific location)
    </ul>

  <p><li>Public Safety App will continuously monitor configured triggers using a variety of techniques, some examples are:
      <ul>
        <li>Identification entered into computerized system (e.g., scan of identification badge, person supplies their name to a receptionist)
        <li>Facial recognition
        <li>Detection of aggressive action
        <li>Sound detection (e.g., gun shot)
        <li>Behavioral anomalies (e.g., someone wearing a heavy coat on a warm summer day, suspicious loitering)
      </ul>

  <p><li>Once hostile actor is identified, their movement within the site will be tracked.
    
  <li>Public Safety App will fire defined Notification Actions (see below) when configured trigger criteria is detected.
</ul>

          <li>higher push rate of real time streams to server
      </ul>
      
  <p><li>Dashboard goes into "crisis mode" (begins to prioritize content based on Public Safety App algorithm)
  <li>Onsite building infrastructure controlled by Public Safety App (e.g., lights, alarms, auto locking doors, elevator control, etc.)
  <li>Continuous push of location of hostile actor to smart phones (e.g., within site map)
  <li>Video and/or still images of hostile actor pushed to smart phones
  <li>Instructions from onsite security or first responders pushed to smart phones
</ul>

      <ul>
          <li>black listed individuals (facial recognition)
          <li>black listed words or sounds
          <li>mass panic (rapid dispersion)
          <li>hostile actions
      </ul>
    
  <p><li>Signal notifications when trigger criteria is met
  <li>When hostile actor is identified, place appropriate camera feeds in dash board (i.e., camera feeds which show hostile actor)
  <li>Place best still image of hostile actor in dashboard
  <li>Continuously adjust dashboard feeds as hostile actor moves throughout the site
  <li>Visually highlight hostile actor in video feeds (to distinguish from others that are trapped)
  <li>Prediction of hostile actor location within site (including time estimates) based on prior movement history
  <li>Hostile action will trigger analysis of historical video streams to look for persons of interest and potential accomplices.

  <li>Smart phone users can configure profile settings.
  <li>Access to system features will be constrained based on user roles.
  <li>Users that aren't preregistered may access Public Safety App (implies extra authentication step).

  <li>When displaying video stream content, the original recording time, distribution time, and current (viewing) time will all be available.
  <li>To minimize lag between video stream collection and viewing, point to point connection will be supported (e.g., first responder will be able to connect directly to onsite cameras).
  <li>System allows for manual control of camera settings (e.g., zoom in / zoom out, camera direction) - assuming hardware permits such action.
