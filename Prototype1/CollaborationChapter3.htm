<ul>
    <p>This is actually a scenario which is near and dear to my heart.  I published an online book with Amazon at the beginning of 2014 and realized that it is virtually impossible to solicit feedback other than via direct email (i.e., I can ask people I know for feedback, or I can try to spam the entire world - but neither option is really very effective).  Plus, as an author, I really don't care how many different web sites host my book (although at present, it is only hosted on Amazon).  But if the book were offered from many different web sites, there would be no way for me to consolidate the feedback (thus those offering feedback would be limited to the various web site hosting platforms).  Ideally, any author would be able to announce the kind of feedback they were looking for (e.g., language experts, fact checkers, those with counter opinions, those with a particular college degree or business background) and allow those interested in supplying feedback to do so in a unified and consistent way.   And those responding would likely only do so if there were a well established and trusted mechanism (e.g., they perhaps would be concerned about their privacy and how their feedback would be used).</p>

    <p>So for authors/publishers, I would say the business needs would be as follows:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Express a desire for feedback and have such feedback centralized (or at least have the ability for centralized feedback).
         <li>Express the kind of feedback desired (by reviewer role and/or reviewer skill set).
         <li>Allow author to organize feedback into categories and/or discussion threads (what ever makes sense for the given content).
         <li>Allow author to control the number of approved reviewers and time period under which feedback is accepted (i.e., they perhaps will need to "close" feedback after a certain amount of time - especially if later editions of a book are to be published).
         <li>Support a means of confirming the qualifications of those offering feedback (meta data and "reviewer ratings" can perhaps help with this).
         <li>Support collaboration and negotiation of feedback - including baselining.
       </ul>

    <p>Benefits:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>Higher quality content (i.e., errors and omissions can be corrected - well, should the author wish to do so).  
          <li>Greater community acceptance (i.e., the mere exercise of community review has a tendency to heighten the sense of team work and collaboration, and sharing of diverse opinions tends to be a good thing in society).
       </ul>
</ul>


<p><a name="2-ClassRoom"></a>
<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, caseStudyMenu, '210px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">2 - Feedback mechanism in a class room setting</em></p>
<ul>
    <p>The benefits of using an automated feedback mechanism as a learning aide are fairly dramatic and apply to virtually all class room settings.  Teachers have been using tests as a means to track student progress since the very introduction of formalized schooling.  And as part of the class room experience, teachers often encourage round table discussions.  This is valuable in the learning experience because it teaches the students how to interact with their peers.  However, in todays high tech work place, it is fairly common to interact with people across a wide range of geographies and time zones, and it is common to use a wide range of communication techniques (e.g., phone, video conferencing, <em title="Short Message Service (also known as 'Texting')">SMS</em>, chat, and email).  So it is essential that students be taught how to collaborate in a virtual classroom setting such that they can express their views and derive optimum output.</p>

    <p>Benefits:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Students will strengthen their review skills (i.e., it is sometimes just as important to recognize opportunities for improvement in the work of others as it is to produce high quality work as an individual).
         <li>Students will learn how to overcome challenges with semantics when working with diverse cultures (sometimes a word or phrase has slightly different meaning across cultures).
         <li>Students will learn how to collaborate with others and value input from everyone (especially when not face to face).
         <li>Students will learn to see the world from a more global perspective (and perhaps realize that there are many ways to solve problems).
         <li>Students might become more engaged in social, political and economic issues (i.e., there is more to express on social web sites than sports, entertainment and gossip).
         <li>Educators will have a mechanized way to manage the learning experience (less paper, less manual effort, more time for true thought and discussion).
       </ul>

    <p>Examples:</p>
       <ul>
          <p>A. Consider a reading passage which has some spelling and/or grammar mistakes.   Each student would be able to mark up the passage and submit corrections.   The teacher would "grade" the feedback (perhaps with the aide of automated software) and supply feedback to the student.  This could be an iterative process until the student is able to identify and correct all mistakes.  A subtle deviation to this exercise would be if students were to review the feedback of other students.</p>

          <p>B. Consider an article about political, economic or social issues (i.e., some "current events" topic).   The students could be asked to submit opinions on the various facets of the article.  Again, feedback could be reviewed by teacher or the entire class.</p>

          <p>C. Feedback competitions - back in the day (i.e., a million years ago when I was in school), we used to have "debate clubs".   Automated feedback mechanisms, especially when coupled with reviewer "rating mechanism" can be an effective means of assessing the most convincing "arguments" on topics of interest.   So a given school can introduce competition across like classes (i.e., to determine which class or student offered the most compelling feedback as voted on by the students, the teachers, or even a designated group of "expert reviewers").  And obviously, competition can be expanded to be across multiple schools, a school district, a state, or even the entire country.   People today are voicing opinions on social websites all the time - what I'm suggesting here is that our school systems merely leverage this natural occurrence such that it steers students in some positive direction and prepares them for jobs in the 21st century.</p>
       </ul>
</ul>


<p><a name="3-CorporateAmerica"></a>
<em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, caseStudyMenu, '210px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">3 - Use in corporate America</em></p>
<ul>

    <p>Adoption within corporate America likely will be more challenging because there is so much fear and distrust (and this perhaps is justified).  <em title="Chief Information Officers">CIOs</em> are very concerned about protection of intellectual property and privacy.  Because of this, most <em title="Chief Information Officers">CIOs</em> restrict use of cloud computing and cloud storage.  In fact, often companies will manage their own storage and intranet.  But I want to point out that the framework requirements expressed in this article don't mandate cloud computing or cloud storage.  In fact, the software should be readily available so that it can be installed behind a company firewall and used by <em title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</em> protected intranet sites.  Now I think that as the software which manages content and feedback becomes more robust and trusted, it is likely that some companies will begin to utilize it as an internet service.  This should be a natural occurrence driven by lower price points due to economy of scale.  The goal of this article is to merely demonstrate the benefits of a consistently available content feedback mechanism.  It doesn't really matter whether such a framework is managed internally by an individual company or outsourced to cloud based service providers. </p> 

    <p>Another reason I think this will be a slightly more challenging area to gain adoption (in corporate America) is because many companies evolve one off custom solutions to satisfy feedback loops.   And often, these one off solutions leverage a combination of 3rd party tools (e.g., Microsoft Office suite, Sharepoint, Lotus notes, custom web apps and custom storage leveraging databases like mysql).   To make matters worse, within large companies, they might actually have many such one off solutions.  And once such strategies are enacted, they have so much historical data that migration to some other strategy becomes too cost prohibitive.  So it is possible that even if/when a mature feedback mechanism is evolved, it might only be adopted in "green field" areas (brand new companies or new departments within an existing company).  Still, as some within corporate America begin to leverage more cost effective strategies, others will have no choice but to follow suite.  So yes, it will take some amount of momentum to begin transitioning away from out dated custom solutions, but as executives continue to look for cost cutting opportunities, it is hard to imagine universal feedback mechanisms not ultimately being adopted.</p>

    <p>But regardless of the above mentioned resistance, I can think of a few different scenarios which would justify evolution of a feedback mechanism to be used in corporate America.</p>

    <p>A. Feedback on new innovations, procedures or products:</p>
       <ul>
          <p>Like authors that solicit feedback on their books, so too is it valuable for companies to solicit feedback on their new ideas.  In fact, it is the exact same problem set with the exact same set of benefits.  </p>
       </ul>
       
    <p>B. Analytics and assessments</p>
       <ul>
           <p>One major challenge corporate America faces is establishing a consistent and effective means of assessing things.  It is common for executives to request "dash boards", but with many one off solutions for defect and feedback tracking, leveraging dash boards becomes rather difficult.   It isn't uncommon for a large company to have many dash boards, and sadly, the information in the dash boards can be drastically different.  This could obviously cause problems for executives that have a wide sphere of control.</p>

           <p>But, with adoption of a single feedback mechanism, it would allow feedback related to any/all content.   And the feedback could be aggregated and/or parsed based on any of the user meta data attributes.   This would give management the ability to precisely analyze the relative quality of its people and work products. </p>  
       </ul>

    <p>C. Feedback as a training aide</p>
       <ul>
           <p>Just as feedback mechanism can serve as a training aide for students, so too does it apply to corporate America.  A user friendly feedback mechanism interface would allow access to valued company resources.   And by unlocking access to such resources, a natural consequence should be more transparency and knowledge transfer.  At present, since feedback repositories aren't frequently used in corporate America, those within companies tend to rely on email or chat - and this is actually the opposite of transparency because email is private.  Yes, people within companies try to manage email as a "database of information", but it is only as effective as the individuals that manage it - and most often this falls drastically short. </p> 
   
           <p>Of course, enterprise search also can serve as a means of "unlocking" valuable company documentation and resources.  But ironically, without a feedback mechanism, rolling out enterprise search can actually have a negative consequence in that everyone is exposed to a ton of stuff - and some of that stuff is either obsolete or flat out incorrect.  So ironically, the need for a feedback and rating mechanism is even more important as a company rolls out enterprise search.  But in my opinion, all of corporate America should have both enterprise search and a rating/feedback mechanism.  They really go hand in hand.</p>

<a name="4-Consumers_watching_video_content"></a>
<p><em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, caseStudyMenu, '210px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">4 - Consumers watching video content</em></p>
<ul>
    <p>As everyone knows, video consumption is probably the biggest preoccupation in our country today.  It is one of our biggest industries, and engages consumers for more hours of the day than virtually anything else (well other than perhaps our jobs, and sleeping).  And yet, tagging software for video content is far behind that of text based annotations.  Sure, people can comment about a given video or audio clip.  But due to the complexity of video encoding, rich players which enable display and maintenance of tags is not common place yet (but I think it will be).  Below are some scenarios which I think can drive the evolution of video (and audio) content tagging.</p>

    <p>Television shows</p>
       <ul>
           Imagine a world where you can mark the start and end of a segment via buttons on your TV remote and then speak into a microphone embedded in the remote.  Then imagine being able to edit the spoken response or have it automatically converted to text.  Also imagine having the ability to view individual and cumulative feedback from others regarding the very same content.

       <p>Benefits:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>Synopsis of highly commented portions could be presented in outline form allowing both consumers and producers to review those specific segments.  This could be a benefit to content producers because feedback might be suggestions on content quality (e.g., things that didn't display correctly, had sound quality problems, or were offensive or inaccurate).  And, it would also benefit content producers because it would allow them to better understand which content had the highest level of consumer enjoyment.  As for the consumers, it allows scanning of certain segments without having to view the entire content.  Sure, companies like ESPN (and others) choose segments for replay.  But it would be nice if individual consumers could merely select portions of the content which they want to see - and community feedback and tagging would go a long way in making that experience better.
          <li>For news shows which have multiple hosts (speakers), segment tagging coupled with favorability assessments would help content producers (and the networks which fund the content creation) in regards to evaluating their on air talent.
          <li>For content producers and distribution channels, this is a no-brainer because it certainly will increase consumer engagement, and that almost always contributes to consumer loyalty.  Plus, the more a subscriber is engaged, the more the distribution channel knows about the consumer, and thus can recommend other shows or services.
       </ul>
    </ul>
       
     <p>Joining live content with the <em title="Digital Video Recorder">DVR</em></p>
       <ul>
           Technically this discussion goes way beyond the DVR (i.e., it really applies to consumption of any video content which is not live, regardless of whether it is consumed from a television, phone or over the  internet).  If tags can be concretely tied to specific segments of an event, then feedback which is time displaced due to delayed consumption can be merged with that of real time feedback.
       
    <p>Benefits:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>Gives a more comprehensive view and more accurately reflects community sentiment.
          <li>Community sentiment for a given bit of content can be measured over time (and thus we can see how opinions change as more information arises and more discussions occur).
       </ul>
    </ul>
    
</ul>
