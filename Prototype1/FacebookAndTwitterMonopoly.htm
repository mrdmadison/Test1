    <p>Of late, many in politics and in the media have raised concerned about how social networking companies like Facebook and Twitter are using, and perhaps abusing, the privacy rights of their customers.  Actually, let me rephrase that, Facebook and Twitter users are not in fact customers, they are actually the "product".  The customer's of Facebook and Twitter are the companies that shell out big money to gain access to all of your private information, including your profile information, and even your posts and content (not to mention, the posts of others that interact with you).   Don't be fooled by the privacy settins which you think you have carefully read - the social media companies make their money on you - after all, you're not paying them directly, so they have to get their revenue from some place else.  And that comes from them tracking every bit of detailed information you offer them when using the social networking platforms.  Sorry to put it such cold terms, but Facebook and Twitter don't really care about their users, well, unless their user's start to defect to other social network platforms.
       
    <p>There has been some talk (in the media) that perhaps our government will get involved and attempt to regulate the social media companies.   I say, "Don't hold your breath."   And, I'm not really sure our government will ever be able to keep up.  If our government zigs, the tech companies will zag.   And besides, our government will be so slow to react, and there will be so much "lobby money" directed at our goverment, that there will be no way they will ever be able to effectively deal with this.  There is only one thing I can think of where our governement can perhaps play a role - and this relates to the evolution of standards surrounding social functions and meta data.  But before I go into detail about this, let me first remind everyone of what powers the internet and has allowed an incrediable explosion of technology, creativity and innovation.

</p>

<ul>
    <p>When people think about the internet, they think about huge amounts of data which is hosted on a gazillion computers ande spread out across the world.  These computers communicate with each other using a complex series of protocols, and rely on network routers to connect everything together.  For the average person, this is essentially pure freakin magic (even for me, and I've worked as a software engineer for over 30 years).  But the explosion of the internet is actually based something even more important, and this has nothing to do with the unbelievably complex architecture which is the foundation of the internet technology.   The thing which actually caused the explosion of web pages, applications, and yes, even social networking companies, are the standards which all the web content is built upon.   The standards which are the most common are:
    <ul>
      <li>HTML
      <li>CSS
      <li>Javascript
    </ul>
    
    <p>It is these standards which have allowed billions of web pages to be created, and it is these standards which have allowed Google (and others) to offer search function which help us find things of interest.   In the first part of this article, I'm going to talk about how stadnards can help inspire competition among those offering social functions, and as such, can lead to improved user experience and privacy policies.  However, I do want to point out that the search function has to be treated separately (i.e., standards aren't really going to do much to impact Google - but don't worry, there are some things we can encourage that might help, but I don't want you to think standards will solve every problem).
</ul>


<a name="SocialNetworkingStandards"></a>
<p><em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, standardsMenu, '250px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Standards for social functions and meta data</em>

<ul>
  <p>Before I go into the notion of standards, let's first consider the kinds of functions which are offered by social media companies (this is not intended to be a comprehensive list - it is more for illustrative purposes):
  
  <ul>
     <li>Blogging
     <li>Email
     <li>Text messaging
     <li>Discussion threads
     <li>Assessments (likes, surveys, etc.)
     <li>Account identity and profile management
     <li>User groups
     <li>Notifications
  </ul>

  <p>Now I've purposefully left off a few from the list above to illustrate how users really aren't being served well.   The following additional social functions could have a huge benefit to consumers, and until standards are evolved, these user functions will probably not be common (if they exist at all):
  
  <ul>
     <li>Full control over privacy
     <li>Port in/port out (including import/export of all user content and meta data) - and once exported, assurance that all data is purged from the original social network provider
     <li>APIs which allow sharing of user's social network data, including group information (assuming appropriate privacy consideration and authorization)
  </ul>
  
  <p>A while back I posted an artcle with some sample requirements - you can look at that if you're interested (if so, <a href="CollaborationChapter1.htm">click here).</a>
</ul>


<a name="ImpactOfSocialNetworkStandards"></a>
<p><em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, standardsMenu, '250px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">What impact would social network standards have?</em>

<ul>
  <p>To understand the impact of social network standards, you first have to consider why there are so few social networking companies, and you also have to consider why all of them use the very same revenue model (advertising and/or selling of personal information).  The first half of the discussion surrounds the relative complexity of the software which drives the social networking companies - this isn't cheap to develop, and since the companies which offer the software want to make money, they invest heavily on the creation and protection of that software.   And, they are equally protective of their user community, because the software cost is mostly fixed, so the only way to turn a profit is to grow the subscriber base.   
  
  <p>And since the early days of the internet were a frantically ivolving eco-system, it was originally born with the notion of free content and services.   As the internet has grown up, companies have reached a saturation point where they are now focused on increasing monitization of their subscriber base.   The days of sell it at a loss and make it up in volume are almost gone, and that has been replaced with the new model of "milk the subscriber base for every last penny".
  
  <p>The last thing to consider with IT services is the notion of the "network effect".  This was something that the government was very concerned about in the 1990s when it went after Microsoft for bundling the IE browser in its operating system.   One of the biggest concerns was that software eco-systems tend to favor singleness of solution (because it is cheaper, and it is easier to integrate when there are less competing factions).   And remember what I mention above, the internet would never have grown as fast as it did absent the standards of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.   Those standards have evolved over time, but extreme care has been taken to consider things like "backwards compatibility" so as to not invalidate all the content which was created under and older version of the standard.   This level playing field allowed for a huge explosion of content and services, but sadly, the social networking companies which were born out of this didn't think to do the same thing with social networking functions.  Of course, also remember that companies aren't really keen on sharing their success with anyone else, so it isn't really surprising that they didn't evolve a baselined set of standards. 
  
  <p>So with this as a back ground, let me now spell out what I think would be the benefit to consumers:
  
  <ul>
     <li>Standards would allow (and encourage) evolution of consistent software applications offered by multiple companies and providers.
     <li>It is likely that some of the software packages would be open source (i.e., free).  There are already some open source projects out there, but they will never reach maturity or any level of scale absent an official spec.
     <li>On top of open source, there almost certainly would be room for premimum software which bundles the open source offering.  This is percisely what is happening in IT today (in other areas) - so there is no reason to assume it wouldn't happen for social networking software.
     <li>Standards like enhanced privacy and port in/port out would benefit consumers in that they would have much better control of their personal experience.  And if they were dissatisfied with a particular social media provider, they could switch to a different provider.  Choice almost always leads to a better user experience at a lower cost.
     <li>Since notifications and news feeds are such a large aspect of social networking software (e.g., most people are getting their news from Facebook today), having a single dominant player like Facebook gives them way too much power.     
  </ul>
</ul>
  
<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<p><em onClick="return clickreturnvalue()" onMouseover="dropdownmenu(this, event, standardsMenu, '250px')" onMouseout="delayhidemenu()">Conclusion</em>

<ul>  
     <p>Now some are probably not quite connecting the dots, so let me fill in some of the gaps.  With standards for social functions, I think there would be more robust and publically available software which could serve as a building block for integration into retail company application software.   Examples of such companies and industries are:
     <ul>
        <li>Telecoms and cable (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Dish network, Time warner)
        <li>Retailers (Amazon, Costco, Walmart, Target, Home Depot)
        <li>Car manufacturers and dealerships
        <li>Home builders and Real Estate
        <li>Utility companies
     </ul>
     
     <p>Remember, it is the standards which allow companies to invest in the software (or pay for a licensed version of the software).  Absent the standards, it wouldn't be financially prudent for companies to take on the challenge of maintaining such complicated software.  Many retailers today attempt to manage a home grown flavor of customer engagement.  But I'm suspicious they would much rather pay for a standard package (perhaps which is customizable and extendible) so that they could focus on their core business.  Retailers tend to look at social functions as a necessary evil - this is why they typically out source such efforts, and this is also why they've lost a considerable amount of market share to companies like Facebook and Twitter.  They'd love to reclaim that revenue, but don't want to go down a rabit hole, so they don't truly invest heaily on customer engagement through social functions.  Retailers realize that they've let a huge amount of revenue leak out (to social networking companies) and would love to reclaim that revenue.   Walt Disney made this mistake when he opened his theme park in California.  He vowed never to make that mistake again - and certainly didn't repeat that mistake when he bought up a huge amount of land in central Florida.  Disney World offers theme parks, hotels, golf courses, resturants, and hole host of other offerings such that most of a customer's vacation dollars end up in Disney properties.  My premise is that if true retail companies could get get into the social networking space, they wouldn't have revnue leak out, and as such could either offer savings to their customers, or take those savings and pass them on to share holders.  That seems better than wasting money on advertising and other fees directed at social networking companies.  The software is modestly cheap to evolve and manage (well, assuming consoidation and consistency), so that fees associated with that software should be modest as well.   But sadly, Facebook is one of the largest companies in the world, and they don't sell anything to their users.   I think it is time for some competition, and standards could definitely help entice competition.
     
     <p>As for the companies mentioned above, they already have a customer base, and since they want to maintain, and perhaps even strengthen, that customer relationship, they have a vested interest in serving that customer well.  As I mention from the very beginning, you are NOT Facebook's customer.  I think this is precisely why Facebook doesn't really care about you - they are in fact using you.   For a while, we were all okay with this because we didn't think we were being harmed.  But now that we realize that they can effectively control all aspects of business (because they are so big), they can effectively tax all of us by inserting a commission fee into all transactions which take place, and we will have little means to opt out.  On the other hand, the companies and industries mentioned above have real tangible products which they sell to us, so they already have a legitimate revenue stream.  And when they take advantage of us, they jepardize losing our business.  This risk/reward model is perhaps the thing which will give them some pause when they consider whether they want to betray our trust by attempting to monitize our personal information.
     
     <p>I'm sure some will question whether standards are that important (after all, aren't things going pretty well as is).  But just imagine where we would be if phone number portability didn't exist.  We take that for granted now, but it took government action to make that happen.  As a software developer, I worked on plenty of projects to roll out wireless number portability and believe me, the Telecoms weren't too thrilled about the government mandate.  But now that it is in place, all the Telecoms have adjusted nicely, and as part of that evolution, today we have near full saturation in the cell phone industry.  I personally believe that email and account management portability should also exist - because absent that, I don't really see how users can be well served.  At present, we are a hostage to our service providers and social networks.   If our government at least ensources standards (and perhaps offered some grant money to get the process started), the service providers and IT companies might take the lead.  If not, then I guess some additional level of government regulations might be in order - but my first preference would be to merely evolve the standards and encourage their adaptation.
