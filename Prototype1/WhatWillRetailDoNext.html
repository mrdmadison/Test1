<B class="HeadingText">What will retail do next?</B>
<br><br>


<p>For the record, this isn't so much about what I think retail businesses actually WILL do next, but instead is what I think they SHOULD do next.  If you've read any of my other work, you'll already know that I'm not a fan of the indirect payment model.  I think indirect payment (e.g., advertisement funded content, all you can eat bundles, etc.) merely cause consumers to over pay for the stuff they truly want, because they end up paying for so much that they don't want or don't use.  It's sort of like paying for a gym membership that you hardly ever use.  Sure, you could work out 24 hours a day if you want - and it wouldn't cost you one extra penny - but are you truly getting a great value?   The sad truth is that consumers have been robbed of the opportunity of paying for things directly - and because of this, we don't even remember why that is a benefit.  After all, once our choices are taken from us, we consider the current reality the new norm, and thus don't even realize that we're being harmed.  So I'm going to protray a modestly different world than what we have right now.  But remember, the world is changing faster now than it ever has in the past (due to technology, outsourcing, and the like), so much of what I'm going to express, even though perhaps surprising, could actually happen.

<p>Before I go into detail about some of the changes which I think will take place, I'd like to remind everyone of some of the changes that have taken place  over the last 30 years.  As I think about these changes, I find it hard to believe I actually lived in a world which was so drastically different than it is today.  And I'm sure that people my age will be amused by the topic, because they too will be reminded of the world they used to know.

<p>The first topic I'm going to call attention to is the so called paperless work place.   For some background, I'm a software developer by trade (have been for 30 years and counting).   When I was in college (in the mid 80s), it would have been unthinkable to have computer programs on any other medium than paper.  Sure, we would type in the computer programs on a monitor (and even that was cutting edge, because some were still using punch cards - hows that for old), but when we ran the programs, we always printed out the output.  And our professors would grade the programs from printed copies.   During the first few years of my professional career, most software developers still printed out their programs.   But somewhere around the mid 90s, printing out computer programs just started to go away.   Developers would review the software online, and as computer monitors and graphical user interfaces got better, the benefits of online consumption so drastically exceeded the benefit of printed copies that computer programmers just stopped using paper.   There wasn't any concerted effort to save trees or be ecologically friendly, it was merely a usefulness equation where printed copies just became less effective.

<p>Photography is another example of something that has been completely transformed over the last 15 years.  A mere 15 years ago, a digital camera which captured .5 mega pixils cost somewhere around 500 dollars.  The talk at the time was that digital photography was a nice gimic but would never replace film.   Well a short 15 years later film based photography is all be gone.   People today exchange 10 mega pixil images in seconds, taken from a device which costs less than 100 dollars.  And btw, that same device also works as a phone that supports video conferencing.   This alone should convince everyone reading this that there is perhaps nothing that can happen in the next 20 years which should suprise you.

<p>And here's one last point about computing in general.  In 1987 I took a tour of a company data center where the mainframe computer took up an entire floor of a building, had water cooling in the floor, and had an entire team of highly paid support personel.  The cost back then was several million dollars, but in todays dollars, that would be upward of 30 million.   And as crazy as this sounds, the average American is walking around with a device in their pocket which has far more computing power, and costs less than 100 dollars.  And on top of all of that, they don't need a team of experts to manage it - they do all of that themselves with a few taps on a touch screen.  

<p>So with this as a back drop, let me now describe how I think retail business needs to evolve in the 21st century.  I think the biggest fundamental challenge is the notion of trust.   And we might as well get something out in the open right away.   No society will ever be prosperous or have any level of stability absent trust.   Sure, law enforcement and the crimial justice system exist as a last resort, but if a society relies on those entities too much, the entire society is doomed.   So at its core, morality, ethics and integrity are essential - and absent this, there is no technology or methodology which will save us.   So in some respects, perhaps I should just stop typing and start preaching (but who would listen?).  So instead of preaching, I'm going to propose that we adopt technology and methodology to do in cyberspace what we already do in the physical world.  As an example, most people lock the doors of their car or home.   But as we all know, locks merely keep honest people honest.  But, they are still very important.   So I think we need better "locks" for cyberspace.  What I propose is that we evolve standards and process for what I refer to as "integrity scoring".   If you think about a person's credit score, this is a measure of a person's ability (or likelihood) to pay for financial obligations.   Credit bureaus have been perfecting this technology for quite a while, and although not perfect, credit scoring is a modestly effective means of measuring a person's credit worthiness.   But what about trustworthiness?  How do we assess the trustworthiness of a person or business?   Below are just a few examples of entities which attempt to assist in this regard:

<ul>
  <li>Better business bureau
  <li>Web sites like Angie's list or Greg's list
  <li>Consumer reports
  <li>Underwriters Laboratories (UL)
  <li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
</ul>
