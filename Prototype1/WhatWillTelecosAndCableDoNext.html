<B class="HeadingText">Where do telecom and cable companies go from here?</B>
<br><br>


<p>Well the obvious answer is convergence (i.e., the merging of voice services, data services, and streaming content).  Now some will say this is nothing new because wireless providers have been doing this for a while.   But what is somewhat new is that cable and wireless companies are attempting to acquire or merge with content producing companies.  And the other interesting aspect is that a decent portion of the content offered over cell phones is actually delivered via wifi through an internet connection (which at least some of the time, brings cable companies right back into the picture).  In this article, I'm going to suggest a potential strategic advantage which is out there for the taking.  It will be curious to see whether telcos and cable companies take advantage of this.

<p>The opportunity that I think exists involves social networking technology.  Out of all the major players in todays business climate, the ones that have the weakest footing (well, in my opinion) are the social networking companies.   Yes, I realize that Facebook and Twitter are hugely popular in today's market place and they have relatively high stock valuations.  But oddly enough, neither has a true product (i.e., they don't actually produce anything).  And I think the fact that they grew so rapidly suggests that their advantage can be undermined just as quickly.   After all, social networking companies only have a few advantages:
<ol>
   <li>The software
   <li>The user community
   <li>Current advertising contracts
</ol>

<p>So let's address each one of theses one at a time.   

<p>Social networking software - sure the software which drives Facebook might be cutting edge, but software can easily be reverse engineered, so any advantage a company has today can be eroded very quickly.   And software developers move around within the industry quite a bit, so software secrets are difficult to keep.  And on top of this, there is ever evolving technology and hardware platforms, so the more legacy code a company has, the less nimble they can be in regards to adapting to the next big thing.  And if you look at the software used by Facebook, it probably isn't that drastically different than some of the other social networking companies.   So from a technology perspective, although perhaps effective, I'm not sure Facebook can preserve its dominance merely by maintaining quality software.

<p>As for the user community, this is rather tricky to handicap.  Although I wouldn't want to bet my house as to when a company like Facebook will experience a major decline, or even predict what would cause this, I think history has demonstrated that attempting to preserve an empire which has little binding it together is extremely difficult.  Twenty years ago it would have been difficult to imagine a world where Yahoo wasn't the dominant web search and advertising company. Ten years ago Google was in the very same position as Yahoo - and actually, since search is so important, Google perhaps had an even stronger position.  But then along came companies like Facebook and Twitter and now both Google and Yahoo are playing catch-up.  But my premise is that since it takes virtually no effort for a person to create an online account, why would anyone think it is easy to lock in consumers indefinitely?  Internet users will gravitate to slick applications which are easy to use and offer the best entertainment and greatest value.  Sure, the momentum for some powerhouse social networking companies is tremendous - just consider how many times you hear those on television say the words, "Follow us on Facebook, or Follow us on Twitter".   But just like consumers, the same holds true for television shows - i.e., it is pretty easy for a host to change to something different, like "Follow me on telco X or cable company Y."

<p>Now the last of the three items above, namely the current contracts, will take some amount of time to unwind.   And my comment about television shows giving a shout out to Facebook might not be completely altruistic (some of the television shows might actually be under contractual obligation to use Facebook - I have no proof of this, but it wouldn't surprise me either).  But regardless of whether they are under contract, or whether they merely use Facebook because it is the rave today, those bonds are modestly weak and will dissolve naturally if there isn't a compelling reason to maintain them.  So as contracts near expiration, and if other startups arise with some slick feature or function, the dominance of Facebook, Twitter, and others will certainly be challenged.  In fact, I think it is very likely that absent bundling of other features, Facebook will almost certainly be usurped (well, at some stage).  And remember, companies with brand recognition have their own web sites and individual dominance, and it is merely linkage to their sites which they crave.   So if some other vehicle offers the same navigation throughput, they can switch in a second and their end customers won't even notice a difference.   As consumers, we really don't care whether we get to our end web site destination via search (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo), or an <a title="Rich Site Summary" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feed</a>, or from a social networking company link.   This is why I suggest that the foundation built by social networking companies is on rather shaky ground.  When retailers share their profit with such companies they leave revenue on the table, and someday, they'll try to reclaim it.

<p>Of course, some will say that I'm biased against social networking companies because I think that user content and feedback should actually be owned by those creating it, and not by the companies that house it.  Now it is true that 3rd party software exists which allows a user to download cloud based content from places like Facebook and Linkedin.  But my concern is that there are no agreed upon standards or <em title="Service Level Agreements">SLAs</em> which guarantee indefinite support so that content can be moved from social networking company X to social networking company Y.  As for the content, the storage of content on servers is rather cheap, and the software to manage the content and feedback is also modestly inexpensive.  In fact, there are teams of developers in India and China that are willing to develop and operate the software for pennies on the dollar.  I've been doing software development for almost 30 years, and although all software companies think their software is the bomb, the reality is that there are plenty of companies which offer roughly equivalent software.  My premise is that someday, content and feedback management will be as common place as user preferences and email/phone contact lists.  My goal is that the software to manage content and feedback would be based on an industry standard so that data could be shared seamlessly, and users could benefit from consistency of function across disparate applications and platforms.  I've actually written a set of <a href="CollaborationChapter1.htm">requirements</a> for feedback management which I hope gets traction some day.  I don't really care whether I'm even involved in the implementation of those requirements, because I feel the evolution of the requirements is way more important for our country than any personal satisfaction I might derive from implementing them (although for grins, I am evolving a prototype - if you're curious, click <a href='FeedbackPrototypeBaseline1.html'>here</a>).

<p>So how can social networking help telcos and cable companies?

<p>Well the short answer is that it is important for distribution channels to engage their subscribers.   If you consider <em title="Internet Service Providers">ISPs</em>, they love it when their subscribers use the email addresses that they supply (as opposed to a generic email service like Yahoo or gmail), because it dissuades users from switching <em title="Internet Service Providers">ISPs</em>.   And it is the engagement with the subscriber base which strengthens bonds and protects against subscriber erosion when some new technology emerges.  But back to social networking companies for a second - I think the most interesting and perplexity question that comes to mind is how did telcos and cable companies allow Facebook, Twitter, and others to gain market share when the telcos and cable companies already had a captive audience.   This is perhaps one of the biggest <em title="(i.e., revenue loss)">heists</em> in recent business history, and I can only guess that many executives were asleep at the wheel and now have to play catch-up.

<p>And it is the catch-up aspect that I'm going to address now.   Telcos and cable companies are certainly behind the curve as compared to Facebook and Twitter.  To make up ground, they must do more than merely evolve a better social networking experience.  In addition to that, they need to encourage standards for social networking which weakens the current <em title="(i.e., foot in the door, first to market)">network effect</em> of the existing social networking companies.  The concepts that jump out the most are:
<ul>
    <li> Open standards
    <li> Information sharing
    <li> Identity integrity
    <li> Portability
    <li> Consistency of function across disparate applications and platforms
    <li> Greater user control over features
</ul>

<p>Since I work in the software industry, I know how powerful standards can be.  In fact, once standards take root, it can be extremely difficult to overcome years and years of use.   Html, css, and javascript are still going strong after all of these years - even though it isn't the easiest ecosystem to work in.   In fact, because these standards were designed to be modestly abstract, multiple browser implementations caused things to become fairly complicated.  But even though many really smart software developers concluded that the standards should probably be changed or clarified, they often had to walk back some of those improvements to maintain backward compatibility.  And ironically, the introduction of new phone and tablet platforms has merely multiplied the complexity of the ecosystem.   So it is possible that some telco and cable company executives might think it is a dangerous time to enter this space (i.e., it is too difficult, too expensive, and there is too wide of a gap to make up).  But I would say now is the perfect time to jump in.  Rolling out standards for social networking functionality will not only enable rapid development of next generation solutions (perhaps even solutions hosted on telecom or cable company servers), but it certainly will retard the existing social networking companies because they have legacy software bloat to deal with.  And certainly, the cable and telecom company executives understand the pain and expense surrounding legacy software (since they probably have to deal with legacy billing system headaches on a regular basis).  And certainly, IT executives know that it is way easier to re-engineer something that already exists than it is to evolve something from scratch.   The blueprint is already out there for what is needed, so the next generation of consistent and portable social networking applications is ripe for the picking.

<p>But one might ask, what is the incentive for the subscribers to migrate away from Facebook and Twitter.   Well the most obvious answer to me is that the telcos and cable companies actually own the <em title="The valued product or service.">cookie</em>, and Facebook and Twitter do not.   Remember that I assert above that Facebook and Twitter don't really offer a real product (i.e., they don't make anything).  Certainly, social networking companies can't take credit for the internet (after all, they aren't Al Gore).  But since telcos and cable companies offer a real service, they should have a huge advantage in regards to engaging their subscribers.   With open standards for social networking (like port-in and port-out), the telcos and cable companies should be able to peel off existing social networking subscribers and migrate them to their own in-house solution.   Once they have the subscribers using their in-house social networking services, they might have a subscriber for life.  At present, subscribers can't easily leave a social networking company because their "stuff" doesn't easily port-out.  But this is where clever telco and cable company marketing strategies come into play.   They should be able to sell the benefits of portability and identity integrity, and perhaps even sell subscribers on the notion of heightened security and better customer service.  Again, these are tangible things from companies that already have some level of subscriber engagement.  I think that they merely need to go the extra mile, evolve social networking standards, and then evolve social networking software which can be run in-house.  Then they will own a real product (i.e., communications and content delivery), and will have subscribers that are heavily engaged using telco and cable company services (like data storage and social functions).  Plus, if subscribers start using telco and cable company social functions, this would open the door for additional advertising revenue and partnerships. 

<p>A real world example:

<p>In the article I wrote on feedback mechanism requirements, I don't go into a ton of detail surrounding annotating video content.   But I think this will be a major trend in the future.   Today, Fox news (and others) are already leveraging Bing to report on real time trending as viewers watch television shows.  And let's not forget how American Idol leverages phone, text and internet services to solicit feedback.  As the software improves, and as standards evolve, I think this will be generally accepted and widely used.  Someday, I would expect that television remote control buttons coupled with voice recording capability (or voice to text) will ultimately support posting of comments tied to very specific segments of television shows.  In fact, I would expect the full breath of feedback functionality (e.g., Replies, Likes, Dislikes) to be as common for video content as Twitter is for text based tweats and retweats.   So I think the prize is out there, the only thing that is needed is improved software to manage and share the feedback, hardware connectivity so that content viewed on television, tablets, or on phones can be tagged, and open standards which encourage the major players to do so in a consistent way.  And note, this last point on open standards and consistency might seem like something telcos and cable companies might shy away from - but my premise is that it is the only way for them to catch-up, and it is the only way to preserve any advantages that they might have.   Because the lack of social networking standards today allows Facebook and Twitter to maintain their dominance, and this is a shame considering the telcos and cable companies actually own a pretty big cookie.
