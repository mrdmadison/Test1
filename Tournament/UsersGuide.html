<b>Tournament manager - Overview</b>
<ul>
    <p>The tournament manager application exists to schedule tournament matches and collect game scores.  One or
    more tournaments can be managed concurrently - tournaments are identified by a "Category".  The category is nothing
    more than a label which helps user distinguish between the various tournaments.  If there are two or more tournaments,
    the category labels will be displayed across the top of the form - this allows for easy navigation between tournaments.
    The main benefit of this particular tournament manager surrounds the complexity of having a two match qualifying round
    followed by one or two playoff rounds.  After entering tournament players, the user will then begin the 
    qualifying round - this will trigger the scheduling of the qualifying round matches.   Once the qualifying round
    begins, the tournament players are frozen.
    
    <p>The user enters match scores until all the qualifying matches are complete.  Once the scores have been confirmed
    (user would typically visually review the scores to see if they were entered correctly), the user would begin 
    the playoffs by selecting either "Start semi-finals", or "Start finals".  Once a playoff round is started, scores in
    an earlier round are frozen.
    
    <p>When scheduling playoff matches, the qualifying round results will be used to rank the players (see playoff ranking
    below for more information).
</ul>

<b>Creating a tournament</b>
<ul>
    <p>When initially starting the application, there would be no tournaments created - so the first thing the user would do is
    select "1. Create a new tournament".  The user will be prompted for a tournament label, a list of players, and number of games to
    win a match.   The tournament label can be anything, but it is recommended that the label be something short so as to not take
    up too space on the form (i.e., if managing tournament from a Smart phone, screen size might be a bit of a challenge).  And note, 
    when switching between tournaments, it is the tournament label which is used to identify a particular tournament. 
    
    <p>Until the qualifying round is started, user will be able to update the list of tournament players - so each time the tournament
    is selected, if the qualifying round is not started, the player list will be displayed.  
    
    <p>Since qualifying round matches are scheduled based on player seeding, the players registered for a tournament should be entered
    based on their ranking (i.e., relative skill level, from top to bottom).
    
    <p>The application manages tournaments of between 3 and 8 players.  If more than 8 players exist, two or more tournaments must
    be created (e.g., if you have 13 players, two tournaments of 6 and 7 players could be used).  Note that separate concurrent 
    tournaments are completely unrelated (from application perspective) so it would be up to the user to distribute the seeded players
    evenly to the various "tournament pools".  Clever use of tournament labels can help when splitting a tournament up into sub-pools
    (e.g., consider labels of "A1" and "A2").  
    
    <p>When starting application where there is previously committed tournament data, those tournaments will be displayed and any
    in-progress tournaments can be resumed.
</ul>


<b>Starting the qualifying round</b>
<ul>
    <p>After players have been entered, the qualifying round can be triggered by the user.  When this is done, the player list is
    frozen and the tournament matches are scheduled.  The application attempts to schedule matches so that all players have roughly
    the same "strength of schedule".  This isn't a perfect formula, but in general, the application attempts to schedule
    one "difficult" match and one "easier" match for each player.  The players "strengh of schedule" is shown in the players list
    (updated once the qualifying round matches are scheduled).
    
    <p>Once the qualifying round is started, the matches would begin and user would enter match results.
    Match results are entered by selecting a particular tournament match and supplying game scores.  See entering game scores below.
    
    <p>Match scores can be added or updated as needed until all the matches are complete.  Once complete, user finalizes the 
    qualifying round by starting the playoff round.
</ul>


<b>Entering match scores</b>
<ul>
    <p>To enter game scores for a particular match, select the match and enter game scores. The following
    rules apply to game scores:
    <ul>
       <li>Game scores are separated by a dash (e.g., 11-9).
       <li>Games are separated by a comma (e.g., 11-9, 11-8).
       <li>Games are played to 11, so one player must have at least 11 points.
       <li>If matches go to deuce (i.e., 10-10), the match must be decided by exactly 2 points.
       <li>Matches are won either best of 3, or best of 5, so based on that setting (expressed when creating a tournament),
           no match may exceed that number of winning games.
       <li>The first player to reach "number of games to win a match" is the winner.  If matches are best of 3, then no player
           may win more than 2 games (for best of 5, no player may win more than 3 games).
       <li>It is invalid for both players to win "number of games to win a match" (e.g., if matches are best of 3, it wouldn't make
           sense for both players to win 2 games).
       <li>Game scores are entered based on the order of the player names in the match.  So for player 1 versus player 2, the following
           game scores would express that player 1 won the match by a score of 2 to 1:   11-9, 8-11, 11-9.
    </ul>
    
    <p>As game scores are entered, the player that is leading in the match will be shown in bold.  Once a player has "won", their
    name will be underlined.  Note that until the playoffs have been started, match results are not finalized, so any mistakes in 
    data entry can be corrected.
</ul>

<b>Starting playoff rounds</b>
<ul>
    <p>Playoffs are started once all the qualifying round scores are entered.  If user attempts to start playoffs when one or more
       matches are still in-progress, the application will issue a warning and not allow playoffs to begin.
       
    <p>Playoff can either be one or two rounds.  For two round playoffs, the user first starts semi-final round.  This will schedule
       the top 4 players from the qualifying round, where top player will play 4th player, and 2nd and 3rd players will play each other.
       
    <p>If user elects to skip semi-finals, then the top 2 players will play in the championship match and the 3rd and 4th players will
       play in a consolation match.
       
    <p>If there are only 3 players in a tournament, there obviously cannot be any semi-final matches.
</ul>

<b>Qualifying round player ranking</b>
<ul>
    <p>Since there are only 2 qualifying round matches per player, there is a high likelihood that match victories alone cannot
       be used as an exclusive means of ranking the players.  So for ties, the following tie breaking algorithm is used:
     
       <ol>
         <li>Match victories
         <li>Bonus points (only applies for players with exactly 1 win)
         <li>Game differential
         <li>Point differential
         <li>Player seeding       
       </ol>
       
    <p>Bonus points are added to players with exactly one win if they have beaten a player who also has exactly 1 win.  This 
       resolves both "head to head" scenario as well as cyclic scenario (e.g., A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A, where D also has
       one win, but only beat a player that has 0 victories).
       
    <p>Overall qualifying round ranking is expressed as a numeric score shown in players list under "Qualifying round ranking".
       The number is derived by multiplying player's win count by 10,000, adding 1,000 bonus points for one win players if they beat
       a player with one win, then adding game differential times 100, and lastly adding point differential.
</ul>

<b>Application technology</b>
<ul>
    <p>The application is pure html and javascript using localStorage to manage application data.  Local storage was used so as to
    avoid the need for server based storage (and the headache associated with user accounts, security, and the like).  It would have been
    possible to merely cache data locally in javascript, but that would suffer from a negative consequence of having all data lost if
    the browser were closed (perhaps by accident).  Tournament data is saved each time it is collected, so nothing is lost.  
    
    <p>Since localStorage is used, tournament data is not publicly available on the Internet.  This is actually a good thing in that
    no data is ever transmitted from the browser.  
    
    <p>Application is only going to work if cookies are allowed (at least for the application's URL).  This perhaps could be changed
    in the future to allow data to only be cached in the browser, but that seems risky since closing of the browser would lose
    all tournament data.
    
    <p>If web data is cleared on the device, this obviously would erase tournament data.  Note that virtually all browsers and
    devices allow web data to be cleared (so users should be careful to not do this accidently while managing tournament data).
    
    <p>Application offers administrative functions at the bottom of the screen to clear local storage as well as dump the internal
    memory of the application.  Dumping of raw application data would typically only be necessary for "debugging" purposes so users 
    would typically have no need to do this.  
    
    <p>If tournaments are played on a daily or weekly basis, it may be desirable to export tournament data and email it somewhere (this
    is at the discretion of the user).  To email tournament data, can merely select data from the screen and paste it into email
    body (same goes for a dump of raw tournament data - e.g., if there were a problem with the application, user could dump 
    the raw data and then email it to a developer for further research).
    
    <p>Since historical tournament data is not managed within the application, if there is a desire to start new tournaments using
    the same tournament categories as earlier tournaments (which is likely the case for periodic tournaments), the user would need
    to clear all local storage (using button on the bottom of the screen).
    
    <p>Since this tournament application manages essentially trivial data about tournament players and match scores, there should be
    no concern about security with respect to exposing personally identifiable or sensitive data.  Plus, since no 3rd party javascript
    libraries are included, cross site scripting attacks aren't be possible.  Still, users should always be careful when entering
    any data on a device, especially when browsers and javascript are being used.   So it is recommended that first name and
    perhaps last name initial be entered (as opposed to player's full name).  And certainly, player's cellphone or email address would likely 
    not serve as a good way to identifying tournament players.  This point is only mentioned to remind users to think about
    Internet security when entering data on any device.
