<h2>My vote for president 2016 - it didn't quite go as planned.</h2>


<p>In an <a href="ElectionChoice.html">earlier article</a>, I explained why I couldn't vote for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.   Instead, I planned to write in Ben Carson.  The following is the story of my voting experience in 2016.  For those that think the system is rigged, you might want to read this - at least for me, it was!

<p>On the way to vote, I was listening to the radio (105.9 Sunny FM) and by chance, heard that there was a Florida law which prohibited taking a picture of your ballot (it is known as the "selfie ballot ban").  I was shocked by this because I had heard on the news that a federal court had already ruled that the ban was unconstitutional.  But apparently not all the states have gotten the message.  This was extremely disappointing to me because I had my camera packed in the car and was ready to vote for Ben Carson.  I had considered merely trying to take a picture anyway, but I figured it would be really hard to sneak my bulky camera into the voting station (after all, I'm one of the few that still uses a flip phone).

<p>So I still voted for Ben Carson, but did not get a chance to take a picture.  I asked an election official and they said I definitely was not allowed to take a picture.  I also asked if I could get a receipt for my ballot - but sadly, they said no to that as well.

<p>I had to cut open all 50 sealed envelops and include a cover letter warning about the selfie ballot ban.  Then I had to reseal all 50 envelops with tape.  It looked pretty cheap, but I wasn't about to spend money on another 50 stamps, and I certainly didn't want to re-address 50 envelops.  But at least I didn't send out an article encouraging people to break the law - that would have been horrible.

<p>Filed a complaint with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.
<p>I wrote ...
<ul>
<p>I think the "no selfie" law (and $1000 dollar fine) regarding taking a
photo of your ballot is not only unfair, but probably is
unconstitutional.  The premise behind a secret ballot is to protect
individual voters from intimidation and the like, it is NOT to suppress
public debate.  And it is completely contrary to our democratic system
to allow for disproportionate influence when you consider the fact that
other states do allow photos of ballots (so the consequence of the
Florida law is to put citizens of Florida at a disadvantage).

<p>For me personally, I voted yesterday, and due to Florida law which will
not even allow my vote to count (because I wrote in someone else for
president), and coupled with the Florida "no selfie" law, my vote for
president was completely voided.  This is NOT the case in other states,
and I am left with little (or no) recourse.  So I'm writing to you to
ask for immediate resolution.   This isn't merely an instance of me
blowing off steam - this is a real case of voter suppression, and I
believe that I have legal standing. I don't like using the court system
for trivial cases, but when the media and those in power have a
disproportionate influence on the outcome of an election, something has
to be done.  So please respond to this email ASAP (within 24 hours).

<p>From my perspective, the only recourse that I think would be fair is to:
<ul>
  <li><p>temporarily relax the selfie law in Florida (with some controls to
      ensure the integrity of the secret ballot)

  <li><p>allow me to mock up a real election ballot so that I can take a
      picture of it (that mocked up ballot would obviously have to be
      destroyed, so this would have to be supervised by an election official).
</ul>

<p>I spoke to an election official when I voted yesterday, and he said that
I could mock up a sample ballot and post that online. But my point is
the power to influence isn't based on a mock up - it is based on an
actual ballot.  Now if the state of Florida offered a "receipt" for my
ballot, then I would be fine with that - but when I asked an election
official for a receipt, they said that wasn't possible.   So from my
perspective, it is kind of like the election never happened for me - and
that is extremely unfair.

<p>Anyway, if I don't hear back soon, I'm going to have to try something
more than just an email.  BTW, I'm not a lawyer, so I have no idea
regarding the process to dispute this (i.e., assuming you tell me that
I'm out of luck), so if you have some "hints" on what my next course of
action would be, that would be appreciated.  I'm not looking to make a
stink about this, I just want things to be fair.  And obviously, if you
wait too long on this, the harm will be irreversible because the
election will be over.

<p>Thanks in advance for your consideration.

<p>Joe, I read your <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/appeals-court-to-review-new-hampshires-ballot-selfie-ban-1473638821">article</a><sup>1</sup> and have an update for you.

<p>I posted this <a href="http://mrdmadison.github.io/Test1/WriteInVote/ElectionChoice.html">article</a><sup>2</sup> a few days ago and mailed out roughly 50 copies to local news, radio, and TV outlets (in Florida).  I had every intention of taking a picture of my "write in" vote in Florida and then posting it online.  To my utter shock, I found out that it is illegal to do so in Florida.   I had read (or heard on TV) about the federal court which ruled that bans on selfies of a ballot were unconstitutional, so I erroneously assumed that it applied everywhere.   Fortunately I heard on the radio (while on my way to vote) about the $1000 fine in Florida, so I voted on Monday but didn't take a picture.  In retrospect, I actually feel like a coward and regret not merely accepting the fine (because I certainly would have fought that like crazy). 

<p>Anyway, I voted on Monday for the candidate expressed on the sample ballot in the article (happens to be Ben Carson), but sadly, due to Florida law which prohibits write in names from even be counted if the person doesn't register in the state as a write in candidate (which BTW, 9 states in the nation don't require preregistration by a candidate), and given the ballot selfie ban, my vote for president is completely ignored.  I feel the process is completely rigged and is designed to stifle the voice of the average American.   In both of my books (on Amazon.com), I talk about how the two party system is killing our country, but until this Monday, I hadn't experienced it quite so vividly.

<p>On Tuesday of this week, I filed an email complaint with the State Attorney General of Florida (Pam Bondi).  I'll include the correspondence below.  This morning, I filed a similar email complaint with the ACLU.  I have little expectation of any resolution between now and the election - which basically means another election cycle will go by the books with the average American being disregarded yet again.  So at this stage, my only hope is to spread the word to the media and pray that someone with influence will encourage Governors to step up and do the right thing.

<p>Anyway, if you could just drop me an email that you got this, it would at least put my mind at ease.  I'm not looking for any attention, and there really is nothing that can be done for me.   But if we can get others to be able to take a picture of their ballot, at least that could potentially give a voice to millions of Americans that feel like their rights have been stepped on.  Just consider all the Bernie Sanders supporters in the country that donated money to his campaign, and due to write in vote registration laws, and anti selfie laws, all those Bernie Sanders supporters literally have no voice at all.  So when Bernie Sanders said the system was rigged, it is a shame that he was one of the people rigging the system.   Because by him not registering as a write in candidate, he basically turned his back on the very people that supported him.   But if the anti selfie ballot law were abolished, those Bernie Sanders supporters that want to vote for him anyway (as a protest to a broken system) could still have a voice.  So if you can, please shed light on this subject and try to restore the voice to millions of Americans.

<p>Here is my complaint to Pam Bondi  (this correspondence was also forwarded to Congressman John Mica and Florida state representative Bob Cortes).

<p>Spoke with an assistant at Bob Cortes' Maitland office.  I was informed that they were researching the origin of the law and were trying to figure out if anything could be done (although it was understood that any action would be very unlikely).  But at least I was able to explain the complaint in detail - so everything is out in the open.  I was informed that it might take up to a week to get any sort of answer.
