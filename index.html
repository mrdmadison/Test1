The following is a sratch pad for ideas surrounding content and feedback management.  The goal is to 
encourage discussion surrounding web site behavior which will benefit both consumers and businesses in this
country.   There are tons of websites which offer feedback and other social functions - but at present, there isn't a ton
of consistency.   To that end, I've started creating some demos, white papers and sample requirements to
help steer discussion in a positive direction.  Note that I probably went off the deep end in regards to some political commentary (in the sample feedback mechanism demo), but you can still see the benefits of the underlying behavior.   And it is the requirements doc and case study which I think are truly valuable.

As for the demos, they are only tested in Chrome and Mozilla (so if you use IE, they probably won't work).
